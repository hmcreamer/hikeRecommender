0,American Lake,Aspen-Snowmass,6.2,9415,11365,1950,3,True,"American Lake is located 3.1 miles from Castle Creek Road in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. It lies near treeline at the top of Devaney Creek in a narrow, high-walled valley.  American Lake and Cathedral Lake are often referenced together because of proximity, however the trails and final destinations are fairly different. The American Lake Trail is distinguished by longer stretches of aspen and near-constant tree cover, while Cathedral is more open with steeper climbs through treeline. American Lake is an ideal choice for active families, runners and seeing autumn colors:  The trail enters the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness and turns up into a thick aspen forest. It winds and climbs steadily through tall aspen and a verdant grass-flower understory, gaining over 800' in just the first mile (1.0 miles : 10,250'). It straightens up the Devaney Creek valley and abruptly transitions from aspen to spruce-fir (1.35 miles : 10,545'). Timber breaks across a large glade at the base of a steep open slope, a great place to see wildlife (1.5 miles : 10,650'). Travel moderates back into the forest, dipping and rising to a second open slope (2.45 miles : 10,970'). The trail is a little more rugged through cluttered stretches to consecutive openings across scree slides (2.75 and 2.95 miles). It continues on a mild grade to the edge of American Lake (3.1 miles : 11,365'). American Lake is bound by steep walls and loose rock on two sides which limit exploration, but the east side is level, thinly treed and easy to maneuver about. Social trails lead through the area to good campsites, and large portions of the shore are easy for anglers to access.",223.216666667
1,Capitol Lake,Aspen-Snowmass,13.2,9468,11597,2129,4,True,"Capitol Lake (11,597') is located 6.6 miles from Capitol Creek Trailhead in the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness. It fills a steep-walled bowl framed by Capitol Peak (14,130'), Mount Daly (13,305') and Capitol Pass (12,078'). The trail drops 400' in .68 miles from Capitol Creek Road to the valley floor, where it turns south beside Capitol Creek and follows it through long intervals of aspen, meadow and airy alpine landscapes to the lake. There are marked connections for Nickelson Creek Trail, Capitol Ditch Trail and West Snowmass Trail, and unmarked climbing routes that split off to Mount Daly and Capitol Peak. The main trail continues .8 miles past Capitol Lake to the pass and drops SW into the Avalanche Creek drainage. Camping is only permitted at designated sites around the lake, and campfires are not permitted at these sites (stoves only). Dispersed camping and campfires are otherwise permitted in the MB-SM Wilderness leading up to the lake (see Camping and Backpacking for details). Capitol Creek Trail sees heavy use, especially on summer weekends. Arrive early to secure choice campsites and avoid congestion on Capitol Creek Road (see important driving notes below): There are two trailheads in the main parking lot - find Capitol Creek Trail and begin a fast descent through mountain shrublands to the valley floor. Flowers are particularly abundant on this sunny, south-facing slope. The trail crosses Capitol Creek on a bridge (.68 miles : 9,070') to the Wilderness Boundary (.7 miles) and Nickelson Creek Trail split (.72 miles : 7,097'). It rises away into thick aspen and curls south on high banks over the creek with good views of open slopes across the valley. The trail crosses a creek (2.15 miles : 9,370') and rises steadily through aspen, glades and brush to a large meadow at 3.0 miles (9,840'). It cuts across the base of this steep meadow to the Capitol Ditch Trail split (3.32 miles : 9,940'), a scenic area along the creek ideal for fishing. The trail continues south through attractive meadows to the West Snowmass Trail split, which comes in from the left (3.9 miles : 10,145'). It crosses a big meadow then steepens into a cluttered forest and passes through a grazing allotment boundary gate (4.4 miles : 10,305'). Travel eases across a meadow (4.75 miles : 10,475') before another steep push up an E-W dogleg and tight switchbacks that lead to a creek at 5.55 miles (10,960'). The trail is potentially vague here but easy to find once across. It continues on a shifting climb through an expanding alpine landscape to the Designated Campsite - Fire Restriction sign (6.17 miles : 11,360'), past which it funnels up a steep gully that opens to big alpine meadows at the Capitol Lake - Capitol Pass Trail split (6.45 miles : 11,563'). Designated Campsite spurs can be found between the gully and this sign. Follow signs left that crest over a scree pile down to Capitol Lake (6.6 miles : 11,597'). The lake is hemmed by steep walls comprised of loose rock - be mindful of falling/sliding rock around the shore. Scale walls and knolls for a better look, or hike up toward Capitol Pass for great views over the basin. Capitol Pass is .8 miles and 510' up from the split to the lake. It's a little easier to backtrack on the established trail than negotiate steep loose rock around the lake to pick it up.",215.966666667
2,Cathedral Lake,Aspen-Snowmass,5.6,9880,11866,1986,4,True,"Cathedral Lake is located 2.8 miles from the Cathderal Lake Trailhead south of Aspen, CO. It fills a large bowl ringed by Malamute Peak (13,348'), Cathedral Peak (13,943') and Leahy Peak (13,322'). This short but feature-filled hike follows Pine Creek through aspen forests into the upper valley, where the landscape opens over treeline up to the lake. Those with time and agreeable weather can divert to Electric Pass (13,485'), the highest pass accessible by trail in Colorado: The trail rises quickly through tall aspen stands to the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness Boundary (.72 miles : 10,425'), where the forest opens across steep, open slopes over Pine Creek. You'll gain 820' in the first mile before moderating on a long open arc with great views up valley (1.5 miles : 11,160'). It crosses a scree field (2.05 miles : 11,555') and scales very steep switchbacks that level to the first split for Electric Pass (2.3 miles : 11,780'). The trail undulates mildly in a thinning forest to an unmarked split for Electric Pass (right), and a sharp turn (left) that drops to a footbridge over the creek (2.58 miles : 11,810'). It continues through treeline across small glades and willow patches to Cathedral Lake (2.8 miles : 11,866'). The east side of Cathedral slopes gently with good social trails around much of the lake (the west side is steep and difficult to reach). Work your way up for aerial views of the lake, and great views down valley. High points around the lake reveal more of Malamute Peak (13,348'), Cathedral Peak (13,943') and a good look at Electric Pass.",229.716666667
3,Electric Pass,Aspen-Snowmass,9.3,9880,13485,3605,5,True,"Electric Pass (13,485') is located 4.65 miles from Cathedral Lake Trailhead in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. It's considered the highest named pass accessible by trail in Colorado. Though ominously named for its exposure to lightning, it's no more susceptible than any other point at this elevation. The route shares the first 2.3 miles with Cathedral Lake, then breaks off on a methodical climb to the rim of a massive cirque that leads precariously on to the pass. The Electric Pass Trail is well conceived with long, sweeping switchbacks on relatively mild terrain. Views are among the best in the Aspen area, rivaled by wildflowers on vast alpine slopes between Cathedral Lake and the pass: The trail rises quickly through tall aspen stands to the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness (.72 miles : 10,425'), where the forest opens across rockslides above the Pine Creek gorge. After gaining 820' in the first mile, travel eases on a long open arc with great views up valley (1.5 miles : 11,160'). It crosses a scree field (2.05 miles : 11,555') to a short section of steep switchbacks to the Electric Pass Trail split (2.3 miles : 11,780'). The trail breaks north into thick willow and clears treeline with Cathedral Lake in sight the rest of the way. Note social trails that branch off down toward the lake on this stretch; keep right at each, and consider them on the return hike for a shortcut to Cathedral Lake. The trail runs up the side of a moraine into meadows at the base of the cirque, where elongated switchbacks begin their way up the NE wall (2.85 miles : 12,160'). Switchbacks shorten up to a saddle that can be mistaken for the pass (4.25 miles : 13,160'). The saddle is a great place to rest and take in views (south) of the route leading to this point, and north over the Devaney Creek drainage, which feeds American Lake. Leahy Peak (13,322') is located east along the saddle, an interesting and non-technical side trip. The trail rises west above the saddle on a tightly wound path that devolves into a faint track across a steep slope with loose and highly unstable scree. Tread carefully on this final run to Electric Pass (4.65 miles : 13,465'), located on a small notch in the cirque wall. Peer NW down Conundrum Creek Valley, and across to Maroon Bells, Pyramid Peak, Snowmass Mountain and a line of distinguished red and white peaks in the heart of the Elk Range. Cathedral Peak (13,943') caps the cirque rim and is seemingly just a frisbee toss away, but technical and unreliable terrain separates the pass from it, as well potential routes that would lead down to surrounding drainages. A short scrambling route continues up to Electric Peak (13,635').",229.716666667
4,Conundrum Hot Springs,Aspen-Snowmass,17.0,8765,11222,2457,3,False,"The Conundrum Hot Springs are located 8.5 miles from Conundrum Creek Trailhead off of Castle Creek Road in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. The hot spring complex contains two main pools and four smaller springs that together discharge approximately 130 GPM with a max temperature just over 100 degrees F (each pool varies). The 8.5 mile distance would usually command a 'difficult' rating, however most consider the trail quite moderate. Strong hikers can easily achieve the roundtrip in a day with an early start. While the springs are the main attraction, the hike in is equally compelling. The Conundrum Creek Trail runs through long stretches of level meadows, aspen forests and valley openings to the springs, with abundant wildlife and open space that's notable for even this expansive wilderness. The springs draw thousands each summer, most who camp in the immediate vicinity. Expect crowds and minimal privacy during peak months, especially weekends and holidays. The springs also serve as a first stop on longer routes to Crested Butte, Copper Basin and East Maroon Pass. See Camping, Rules and Regulations and Worth Noting below for important information on designated sites, fire restrictions, dog restrictions and travel tips: The trail dips and rises across a broad meadow that funnels into conifer and aspen along the creek (1.0 miles : 8,970'). It emerges in a small meadow at 1.75 miles, then the first of several major meadows at 1.85 miles (9,240'). Travel is quick to a bridge leading to the west side of the creek (2.75 miles : 9,390'). The bridge is elevated and narrow - consider crossing in the water if slick or carrying a heavy pack. Mild grades continue across a second large meadow at 3.85 miles (9,550'), past which it steepens on rugged terrain above a deep gorge in the valley (4.5 miles). Note young aspen and fireweed on these steeper slopes, which indicate a recent disturbance that renewed the natural forest cycle. The trail enters a third major meadow at 4.8 miles that stretches (with brief interruption) to a bridge leading east to the Silver Ponds (6.0 miles : 10,240'). Note dogs are not permitted beyond this point. The trail skirts marshy ponds to a marked creek ford back to the west side (6.55 miles : 10,320'). The ford can be voluminous at peak runoff, but is generally safe and easy. The trail opens across a talus field with your first clear view of the upper valley (7.2 miles : 10,455'). It steepens away in a cluttered forest to a sign on the hot springs perimeter (8.15 miles : 10,965'). Camping is only permitted in designated sites beyond this point, and fires are not permitted. There are several campsites just before this sign along the creek where fires are still permitted. The trail hops a creek braid and opens past spurs for designated sites to the split for Triangle Pass. The Conundrum Hot Springs are located across the creek about 100 yards away (8.5 miles : 11,222'). There's one large pool and one small pool in the main area where most people congregate. Clothing is optional, and expect a lively crowd. The springs are at treeline in a valley topped by Cathedral Peak (13,943'), Conundrum Peak (14,022') and Castle Peak (14,265'), which share a similar geologic make-up and appearance to Maroon Bells. The Conundrum Creek Trail continues 2 miles and 1700' up to Triangle Pass.",217.883333333
5,Triangle Pass,Aspen-Snowmass,21.0,8765,12919,4154,5,False,"Triangle Pass is located 10.5 miles from Conundrum Creek Trailhead in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. It spans a small notch in the west valley wall above Conundrum Hot Springs, with terrific views and continuing passage to Crested Butte (Gothic), Copper Basin and East Maroon Pass.  While the Conundrum Creek Trail is among the most heavily traveled in Aspen, few continue two miles beyond the hot springs to the pass, which is removed from more popular backpacking routes such as the 4-Pass Loop and West Maroon Creek Trail to Crested Butte. Triangle Pass offers comparable scenery without crowds. The hike in is distinguished by expansive meadows, aspen groves and moderate grades to the Hot Springs. Travel steepens into the capacious upper valley topped by Cathedral Peak (13,943'), Conundrum Peak (14,022') and Castle Peak (14,265'), which share a similar geologic make-up and appearance to Maroon Bells (also visible from the pass). Visitors will enjoy miles of open valley travel and lightly used backpacking route options from Triangle Pass: The trail dips and rises across open space that funnels into conifer and aspen along the creek (1.0 miles : 8,970'). It emerges in a small meadow at 1.75 miles, then the first of several major meadows at 1.85 miles (9,240'). Travel is quick to a bridge leading to the west side of the creek (2.75 miles : 9,390'). The bridge is elevated and narrow - consider crossing in the water if slick or carrying a heavy pack. Mild grades continue across a second large meadow at 3.85 miles (9,550'), past which it steepens on rugged terrain above a deep gorge in the valley (4.5 miles).

The trail skirts marshy ponds to a marked creek ford back to the west side (6.55 miles : 10,320'). The ford can be voluminous at peak runoff, but is generally safe and easy. The trail opens across a talus field with your first clear view of the upper valley (7.2 miles : 10,455'). It steepens away in a cluttered forest to a sign on the hot springs perimeter (8.15 miles : 10,965'). Camping is only permitted in designated sites beyond this point, and fires are not permitted. There are several campsites just before this sign along the creek where fires are still permitted. The trail hops a creek braid and opens past designated sites to the split for Conundrum Hot Springs and Triangle Pass (8.48 miles : 11,195'). The springs are just 100 yards away over the creek, and the main trail continues right past the last designated sites and clears treeline. Here the valley truly opens with expanding views across the entire drainage. Grades steepen through willow mats that give way to rolling meadows. Scan this vast area for elk and goats as you go. The trail climbs in short steep spurts with several deliberate bends toward the west valley wall (9.5 miles : 12,045'). There's a saddle on the valley headwall (due south) that appears to be your destination, but in fact that's Coffee Pot Pass. The trail edges closer to the west wall before turning sharply up switchbacks across loose scree and till to Triangle Pass (10.5 miles : 12,919'). The pass is an unassuming col high on the valley wall, with panoramic views across Conundrum Valley. Maroon Bells and a line of peaks in the Elk Range can be seen to the north and west, where the trail tilts down a winding path to Copper Basin and on to Gothic north of Crested Butte.",217.883333333
6,Difficult Creek Trail,Aspen-Snowmass,6.0,8145,9517,1363,3,True,"The Difficult Creek Trail runs 3 miles above and along Difficult Creek in the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness. This moderately strenuous trail begins at Difficult Creek Campground just outside Aspen, crosses the Roaring Fork River and joins Difficult Creek through diverse montane forests. The trail is maintained for 3 miles with unmaintained segments that intuitively follow the creek deep into the backcountry. The maintained portion is subjectively unspectacular, but provides a good workout with the opportunity to explore a lightly traveled drainage in the Collegiate Peaks: The trail begins on a level path through diverse scrub and aspen to a long bridge over the Roaring Fork River (.18 miles) and Collegiate Peaks Wilderness Boundary, where it briefly meets Difficult Creek (.48 miles : 8,230'). It follows it for a short time before rising away in a predominantly coniferous forest touched by beetlekill and deadfall (1.0 miles : 8,525'). Grades steepen to a small stream crossing (1.7 miles : 8,970'), past which the trail bends west across a rocky hillside with partial views of peaks over Independence Pass (2.0 miles : 9,170'). It meets back up with Difficult Creek (2.5 miles : 9,375') and turns south beside it with many easy access points. The trail gradually levels in a mixed forest just east of the creek and to an unmarked point where maintenance officially ends (3.0 miles : 9,517'). The Forest Service suggests there are old cabin remains in the area, though none were observed on this report. The trail gradually fades past this anticlimactic point, but travel intuitively follows the creek with nominal elevation gain into wide, level sections up the valley. Nicely spaced trees provide good viewing lanes for wildlife with manageable clutter for off-trail exploration.",220.316666667
7,Copper Lake Loop,Aspen-Snowmass,23.35,8755,8765,4164,4,False,"Copper Lake (11,321') is located 10.65 miles from East Maroon Creek Trailhead on the Crested Butte side of East Maroon Pass (11,824'). This small but shapely lake sits at treeline .95 miles and 503' below the pass, and 4.8 miles from the Copper Trailhead in Gothic where thru-hikers can arrange pick up.  Those looking for a more interesting return from Copper Lake to Aspen can follow a connector trail to Triangle Pass (12,911') and drop down Conundrum Creek to form a 2-car shuttle loop (it's a relatively short drive between trailheads). This longer and more challenging route features a stunning traverse across the Copper Valley headwall and a stop at Conundrum Hot Springs on the 10.5 mile descent from Triangle Pass. Camping is only permitted in 8 designated campsites at Copper Lake (6 + 2 for stock). Fires are not permitted at these sites and within 1/4 mile of the lake. See below for more information on camping, fees, permits, bear canisters and trailhead directions and access: The trail begins on level intervals of meadow and aspen to a connector for Maroon Lake (1.3 miles : 9,070'). Here it bends SW into the East Maroon Creek drainage with views of Pyramid Peak (14,018'). Travel is quick on mild grades past a riparian restoration area (2.7 miles : 9470') to an unmarked spur for a horse camp (4.2 miles : 9,725'). Traces of an old road are periodically evident past cabin remains (4.9 miles) to the first of two creek fords (5.6 miles : 9,880'), which can be swift at peak runoff. Once over it rises sharply to an avalanche-cleared slope and the second ford back to the east side (6.45 miles : 10,235'). It climbs steeply to a long, arcing talus slope (7.0 miles : 10,605') and steadies on sections of the old road. Stay vigilant, as the trail veers right at a potentially unmarked point (7.7 miles : 10,935'). Though maps indicate a clear split, it's very easy to miss. Staying left keeps you on a clear path that fades above treeline on the east side of the valley heading toward Copper Pass - east Maroon Pass is located on the NW side of the valley. Timber thins as you turn NW across the top of East Maroon Creek (8.5 miles) to a large basin under the pass (8.8 miles). The trail curls up the west valley wall on a ramp-like path to East Maroon Pass (9.7 miles : 11,824'). It drops from the pass and makes a sharp hairpin turn with your first look at Copper Lake, then takes a long arcing descent into the basin. The trail drops to a 3-way split for Triangle Pass, the lake and campsite access (10.55 miles : 11,405'). Take the unmarked spur down to Copper Lake (10.65 miles : 11,321'). Distances noted here omit the .2 mile roundtrip spur to Copper Lake: To continue on the loop, follow signs for Triangle Pass which lead up and undulate to the Copper Creek Trail split (10.9 miles : 11,420'). The trail bends east and steepens across the talus-strewn headwall with long views down Copper Creek valley. At 11.95 miles the trail curls across the headwall's highest, steepest slopes toward Triangle. You'll encounter a few narrow sections that may be unsafe to cross with snow cover. Travel gradually moderates across broad slopes up to Triangle Pass (12.85 miles : 12,911'). The trail drops from Triangle Pass into the Conundrum Creek drainage on a steep, winding path that moderates across attractive alpine meadows to a spur for Conundrum Hot Springs (14.85 miles : 11,190'). The springs are a quick detour across the creek. The main trail continues back through treeline on a steady descent in varied terrain to a wide creek crossing, which can be swift at peak runoff (16.8 miles : 10,320'). Find the shallowest way across and resume variously rugged travel down to a long bridge back over the creek at Silver Pond (17.35 miles : 10,240'). Once across travel gradually moderates in the mid-lower valley across expansive meadows separated by aspen groves and mixed timber to the Conundrum Creek Trailhead to complete the loop (23.35 miles : 8,765').",218.433333333
8,East Maroon Pass,Aspen-Snowmass,19.4,8755,11824,3069,3,True,"East Maroon Pass is located 9.7 miles from East Maroon Portal in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. This long but moderate trail follows East Maroon Creek to its origin just below the pass, and continues down the west side into Copper Basin and on to Gothic near Crested Butte.  East Maroon Pass is arguably the easiest thru-hike route to Crested Butte, though it lacks the high alpine charisma of West Maroon Pass (12,465'). Much of the trail follows an old wagon route chosen for milder grades and lower elevations. Accordingly East Maroon sees heavier horse traffic than any other stemming from Maroon Bells. It also joins Triangle Pass (via Copper Basin) and the Conundrum Creek valley to form a compelling backpacking loop. This is a great option if seeking solitude apart from the busy 4 Pass Loop network. Highlights include long stretches of open valley, great views of Pyramid Peak and some of the finest aspen groves and autumn colors in the area: The trail begins on level intervals of meadow and aspen to a connector for Maroon Lake (1.3 miles : 9,070'). Here it bends SW into the East Maroon Creek drainage with views of Pyramid Peak (14,018'). Travel is quick on level grades before rising above a riparian restoration area (2.7 miles : 9470'). Look for moose in beaver-dammed oxbows below. It drops back on a fast pace to an unmarked spur for a horse camp at 4.2 miles (9,725'). Traces of the old road are periodically evident past cabin remains (4.9 miles) to the first of two major creek fords (5.6 miles : 9,880'). Volume can be swift across each at peak runoff - anticipate knee high+ water. Once through it rises sharply into a coniferous forest that breaks across an avalanche-cleared slope to the second ford back to the east side (6.45 miles : 10,235'). It climbs steeply to a long, open arc across a talus slope (7.0 miles : 10,605'). Find raspberries tucked in the rocks, and good views of Pyramid Peak and adjacent ridges that form the west valley wall. The trail continues steadily in a pleasant but nondescript subalpine forest on sections of the old road. Stay vigilant, as the trail braids in several places and makes a key right turn at a potentially unmarked point (7.7 miles : 10,935'). Though maps indicate a clear split, it's very easy to miss. Veering left keeps you on a clear path that fades above treeline on the east side of the valley, heading toward Copper Pass. Keep right at all braids and forks that lead NW across the valley. Timber thins as you turn NW and cross the top of East Maroon Creek (8.5 miles) to a large basin under the pass (8.8 miles). There's some great camping terrain in this area. The trail curls up the west valley wall on a ramp-like path to East Maroon Pass (9.7 miles : 11,824'). Continue down the far side for views of Copper Lake, or take a social trail to more central points in the valley with excellent views down the entire drainage. Elk and mountain goat are active in this rich and lightly traveled part of the valley.",218.433333333
9,East Snowmass Trail,Aspen-Snowmass,14.1,8422,12684,4262,5,True,"East Snowmass Trail runs 7.05 miles south from the backside of Snowmass Ski Area to a 12,684' pass separating the East Snowmass Creek drainage and Willow Lake basin. It continues approximately 1 mile and 680' down to the Willow Lake Trail, which rolls .7 miles across open alpine meadows to the lake (11,795'). The East Snowmass Trail is a lightly used route into the heart of the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness, an ideal choice for strong hikers looking to avoid crowds that emanate from Maroon Lake (there's also no fee). The trail is distinguished by nearly 5 miles of open valley travel framed by colorful red walls leading up to the pass. It can be linked with the Willow Lake and Maroon-Snowmass trails to form a loop that scales Willow Pass and Buckskin Pass before dropping to Snowmass Lake and the Maroon-Snowmass Trailhead, just a few steps up the road from where you started. Whether tackling it as a day hike or part of a longer backpacking route, get an early start to avoid summer storms on this exposed and challenging trail: The East Snowmass Trail climbs steeply through aspen and mixed pine to the Wilderness Boundary (.65 miles) and Ditch Trail split (1.12 miles : 9,105'). It keeps a similar pace through diverse forests before emerging in open space (2.2 miles : 9,755') and moderating across rolling meadows in the lower valley. It rises steadily with several short, steep intervals across open slopes to consecutive stream crossings at 3.45 miles (10,555'), the second of which is veiled by heavy brush. Once through it enters a tall spruce-fir forest and eases for half a mile before another steep push leads to flat, stream cut meadows on the valley floor (4.3 miles : 11,040'). This is arguably the finest stretch to camp on the East Snowmass Trail no matter your final destination. The trail steepens past the meadows through the last bands of timber to treeline (5.1 miles : 11,455'). Travel now moderates across an expansive alpine landscape that rises incrementally to the pass. At 6.0 miles (12,015') it bends SE and dips past an unmarked fork (keep left) and crosses a stream to the east side of the valley (6.35 miles : 12,065'). Once over it rises steeply up the east valley wall to East Snowmass Pass (7.05 miles : 12,684'). The pass spans a small notch on the valley headwall with exceptional views across the Willow Lake basin and a line of peaks across the Elk Range. It continues south on a very steep descent to the Willow Lake Trail split, which is .7 miles from the lake and .8 miles from Willow Pass (12,572').",214.766666667
10,Fryingpan Lakes,Aspen-Snowmass,9.1,10012,11032,1020,3,True,"The Fryingpan Lakes are located 4.55 miles from Road #505 (5.7 miles south of Fryingpan Road) in the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness. The two main lakes are separated by a wide isthmus, and a third lake .7 miles below offers a comparable aestehtic with more accommodating space for camping. The Fryingpan Lakes form the headwaters of the Fryingpan River, a major tributary of the Roaring Fork celebrated for its 14 miles of Gold Medal Waters on the tail of Ruedi Reservoir. While thousands visit the Fryingpan each summer to fish and recreate on Ruedi Reservoir, few venture up to this free-flowing headwater just west of the Continental Divide. Mild-moderate grades follow the river through subalpine forests, open valleys and wide meadows to the lakes. This lightly used but well-maintained trail is ideal for backpackers, families and trail runners, and features good wildlife viewing and abundant flowers across long open slopes. An unmaintained route continues over the Divide below Deer Mountain (13,761') into the Lake Creek drainage near Independence Pass: The trail begins near the Marten Creek - Fryingpan confluence and rises quickly into a moss-draped forest. It reaches the H-F Wilderness Boundary (.4 miles : 10,085') and crosses a big open slope at .92 miles (10,280'), the first of several high clearings leading to a wide bridge over the Fryingpan River (2.35 miles : 10,602'). The trail continues south up the east side of the river with expanding views across the valley. It crosses the base of a rockslide (2.85 miles : 10,742') and resumes moderate travel into a big, level meadow (3.45 miles) leading to the first lake (3.75 miles : 10,933'). The lake is small but lies in a wide, flat section of the valley with ideal camping terrain and views of Mount Oklahoma (13,845'). The trail undulates around the rugged east shore to gentle terrain along the inlet where campers will find more privacy during peak summer months (4.0 miles). It re-enters the timber and negotiates a shifting, rugged path through large boulders to the first Fryingpan Lake (4.4 miles : 11,024'). The trail picks through more of the same to a large isthmus separating the upper and lower lakes (4.52 miles : 11,032'). The isthmus is wide and slightly elevated, offering great views of both lakes and the upper valley. Tall knolls around the lakes provide good vantages but require a little scrambling to reach. A short stream bisects the isthmus and connects the two lakes. The main trail continues into a meadow-like inlet area and follows an unmaintained route up to the Divide.

11,Granite Lakes,Aspen-Snowmass,13.4,8815,11568,2753,4,True,"The Granite Lakes are located 5.95 and 6.7 miles from Mt Nast Colony Road in the Hunter - Fryingpan Wilderness. The lower lake (11,319') sits just below treeline against the west valley wall, and the upper lake (11,568') is .75 miles ahead in a more open setting at treeline. Both lakes are relatively small but with enough space to camp and fish abundant trout stock. The trail begins in Nast (31 miles east of Basalt) and follows the Fryingpan River 3.4 miles before turning up Granite Creek and climbing 2100' in just 3.3 miles to the lakes. It sees light use with short sections along Granite Creek that may require route finding. Visitors will enjoy miles of river access, healthy forests and solitude on the hike to Granite Lakes: Walk from the designated parking lot and bear left onto Mt Nast Colony Road to find the trailhead on the left. The trail begins on a level path between private homes and the river. It runs fast to the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness Boundary (.98 miles : 9.045') and undulates along the river in a heavy forest. Stay alert across vague and shifting sections. The trail reaches a sparingly marked fork where social trails continue along the river and the main trail splits right into the Granite Creek drainage (3.4 miles : 9,490'). It steepens considerably to meet Granite Creek at an outcrop over a small waterfall (3.75 miles : 9,835') and keeps a challenging pace beside scenic (albeit hard to reach) cascades. The trail abruptly fades in a cluttered forest where cut logs indicate a designated route but little else (4.35 miles : 10,330'). Options are limited, but the intended route crosses the creek (left) at 4.55 miles, follows a short rugged stretch along the water and crosses back (right) over a small stream at 4.7 miles into a big meadow. Cairns lead up the right side to another stream crossing (4.83 miles : 10,575') past which travel clarifies on a steep push up the valley wall to Lower Granite Lake (5.95 miles : 11,319'). The lake is embedded in the west valley wall with open grass and level timber on the east side. There are a few particularly good campsites at the lake. The main trail moderates in a high and thinning forest to Upper Granite Lake (6.7 miles : 11,568'). This final segment can be vague (especially with snow cover) but is generally easy to follow. The upper lake is small with open grass around much of it that creates a spacious feel.",246.016666667
12,Hay Park Trail,Aspen-Snowmass,14.9,8482,9370,888,3,True,"The Hay Park Trail runs 7.45 miles from Capitol Creek Road west of Old Snowmass to the Thomas Lakes Trail above Carbondale. This long but moderate trail passes through aspen-covered slopes cut by several creeks and high meadows with great views from Capitol Peak to Mount Sopris. Hay Park includes 9980 acres of valuable mid-elevation habitat that's part of the Hay Park Wilderness Addition Proposal to the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness Area, an initiative that envisages a road-less 200,000+ acre block in the Roaring Fork Valley. The Hay Park Trail is ideal for running, biking and equestrians, with miles of contiguous aspen that make it a great autumn choice. This corridor supports abundant wildlife and is open to hunting (public lands only). Be mindful of hunting seasons and wear bright colors during these periods. There are several unmarked splits off the Hay Park Trail that can easily be confused for the main trail. Carry a good map and have a general understanding of your route before heading out. Respect private property lines and remain on designated trails. Note that distance and elevation gain figures will vary between sources depending on which trailhead you start at - Hay Park or Thomas Lakes - and where the source determines the trail to officially begin and end. The following description begins at Hay Park Trailhead on Capitol Creek Road and runs north to its merge point with the Thomas Lakes Trail: From the Hay Park BLM Lot, cross a pasture to the Backcountry Board (.23 miles) and begin a steep climb through dense aspen. Pass through a gate (.7 miles) and cross a road to regain the trail. It drops to another road at .88 miles (9,020'); turn left and split off the road (left) at 1.1 miles. It narrows back on singletrack, dips across a small stream and rises through tightly-lined aspen (1.5 miles : 9,140'). Enjoy a brief opening at 1.75 miles to a fork that splits right (1.9 miles : 9,245'). You'll exit the Capitol Creek Land Co Private Property Boundary at 2.0 miles and hop consecutive creeks at 2.2 miles (9,175'). Travel is fast and nondescript through greater concentrations of fir to East Sopris Creek (2.8 miles : 9,205'), past which mature aspen take over with good viewing lanes. The trail undulates to a subtle fork at 3.35 miles; keep right and curl steeply down into a shallow gulch and cross another stream (3.38 miles : 9,185'). It rises out and moderates across high clearings in a park-like setting with terrific mountain views (3.65 - 4.15 miles : 9,345'). The trail drops to a small pond and fork with no signage (4.25 miles : 9,305') - the following description continues up the left fork on the far, upper slope of the pond: The left fork steepens out of the forest and passes through a fence into big open space (4.8 miles : 9,645'). Travel moderates across high, expansive meadows to a second fence at the trail's highest point (5.2 miles : 9,710'). This is a great place to see elk with panoramas that include Capitol Peak and Mount Sopris. It's also a sensible turnaround point, as travel is more business-like to the terminus. The trail dips into a stream-crossed meadow and funnels onto a service road that drops sharply to West Sorpis Creek (6.25 miles : 9,540'). It crosses and moderates in mixed timber that breaks across open slopes to the Thomas Lakes Trail split (7.45 miles : 9,370'). It continues down as the Thomas Lakes Trail for 1.7 miles to the Thomas Lakes Trailhead on Dinkle Lake Road outside Carbondale.",207.1
13,Williams Lake,Aspen-Snowmass,3.8,10010,10815,805,3,True,"Williams Lake is located 1.9 miles from Hell Roaring Trailhead on Capitol Creek Road in the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness. It lies in a heavily wooded basin off the Hell Roaring Trail, which continues west across the Elk Mountains to the Avalanche - Silver Creek Trail outside Carbondale. Williams Lake famously inspired John Denver's 'Rocky Mountain High' while he was camping at the lake to view the Perseid Meteor Showers which happen every August. Though Williams Lake lacks the alpine luster of others in the area, it's a great choice for families, anglers, short-distance camping and simply escaping the crowds. Hardscrabble Lake is just .1 mile off the main trail with notably good fishing. The Hell Roaring Trailhead is located 10.7 miles west of Highway 82 on Capitol Creek Road. Only capable 4WD cars with experienced drivers should attempt to reach this trailhead by car. You may otherwise park at Hay Park (7.8 miles from HWY 82) or Capitol Creek Trailhead (9.5 miles from HWY 82) and walk the road. Good high clearance is necessary beyond Hay Park. These park-and-walk options add 5.8 and 2.4 miles to the roundtrip hike, respectively. Always call ahead for driving conditions, as this road is subject to washout and deadfall: The trail rises steadily in a heavy spruce-fir forest to the Hardscrabble Lake Trail split (.28 miles : 10,140'). Hardscrabble is more of a pond than lake, but has excellent fish stock. The trail continues on short, steep intervals to the Williams Lake Trail split (1.05 miles : 10,460'), which splits north and drops across two bridges spanning a marshy corridor (1.12 miles : 10,405'). It gradually bends NW beside the lake's outlet stream up to Williams Lake (1.9 miles : 10,815'). The lake is ringed by thick timber with limited open space, but many social trails fan through the area to numerous campsites and access points along the shore.",207.1
14,Hunter Valley Trail,Aspen-Snowmass,8.9,7905,8972,1067,3,True,"The Hunter Creek Trail joins the Hunter Valley Trail to form an 8.9 mile out-and-back route east of downtown Aspen. The hike features scenic bridges over Hunter Creek and expansive, aspen-ringed meadows with alpine backdrops in the Maroon Bells and Hunter-Frying Pan wilderness areas.  The Hunter Creek Trail climbs steeply along the creek to a big meadow at 10th Mountain Bridge, where the Hunter Valley Trail continues east up the north side of Hunter Creek until fading out shortly past the last cabin remains. The Hunter Creek trail system sees heavy use, especially on summer weekends. Honor yield protocols and posted leash laws. There are several access points and potential routes for reaching Hunter Valley Trail - the following description begins on Lone Pine Road in downtown Aspen: From Lone Pine Road, follow signs behind the residential area to boardwalks along the creek and consecutive bridge crossings (.3 and .47 miles). Note diverse vegetation in this riparian corridor, including large cottonwoods ain the creek channel. Grades steepen past the Lani White Trail split (.5 miles : 8,050') to a 3rd bridge (.65 miles) and Benedict Bridge - Red Mountain BLM Trailhead spur (.95 miles : 8,370'). Cross Benedict Bridge back to the south side, where steep travel continues past the Verena Mallory Trail split (1.15 miles : 8,525') and over a service road (1.4 miles) to a Backcountry Board + Map on the edge of a large meadow (1.6 miles : 8,655'). The valley opens and levels past the Hunter Creek Cutoff Trail (1.7 miles : 8,665') to the 10th Mountain Bridge and first sign for the Hunter Valley Trail (1.85 miles : 8,695'). Here you may cross the bridge or continue straight to another at 2.6 miles (8,790') - both lead to the north side of Hunter Creek and continue on as the Hunter Valley Trail. The routes are virtually equidistant; the following description keeps straight to the 2.6 mile bridge. The 2.6 mile bridge crosses Hunter Creek and a series of scenic pools ideal for fishing. The meadow expands considerably in a park-like setting with the Elk Mountain's distinct red-hues framing the west, and high peaks in the Hunter-Frying Pan to the east. Travel levels on near-perfect singletrack through the meadow to a rise at 3.5 miles (8,880'), which drops you back into a similar but smaller meadow. The trail moves quickly to the far end, where the valley rapidly tapers in thicker timber to the last cabin remains on the left (4.45 miles : 8,972'). It continues past the cabin and is intuitively followed along Hunter Creek, but soon loses clarity and is absorbed by heavy brush.",211.15
15,Deadman Lake,Aspen-Snowmass,13.6,11506,10965,541,4,True,"Deadman Lake is located 6.8 miles from Independence Lake Trailhead in the Hunter-Frying Pan Wilderness. It lies in a wide, level meadow along the South Fork Frying Pan River. While the lake aesthetic is nondescript, the hike in is exceptional. There are two ways to reach Deadman Lake from the Lost Man Loop Trail off of Highway 82 (east of Aspen, CO). Arguably the most scenic begins at Independence Lake Trailhead and scales Lost Man Pass to Lost Man Lake, and on to the South Fork Pass Trail. The South Fork Pass Trail leaves the busy Lost Man Loop and drops into the South Fork drainage, a lightly visited area that supports high concentrations of wildlife. Visitors will enjoy two alpine passes, three lakes, three valleys and great camping on the hike to Deadman Lake: The trail begins at treeline up to the Hunter-Frying Pan Wilderness Boundary and split for Linkins Lake (.15 miles : 11,615'). It crosses the Roaring Fork (.48 miles : 11,735') and keeps a steady pace between Twinning Peak (east) and Geissler Mountain (west) up to Independence Lake (1.8 miles: 12,487'). Independence Lake fills a shallow bench under Lost Man Pass, with a large tarn .1 mile away that's easy to reach and worth exploring. The trail follows the level shore before turning sharply up to Lost Man Pass (2.35 miles : 12,810'). Lost Man Pass spans a divisive ridge between the Roaring Fork headwaters (south), and the Lost Man Creek drainage (north). Views of the Collegiate Peaks are outstanding from the pass. The trail tilts down steep switchbacks across short sections of talus to Lost Man Lake (2.75 miles : 12,482'). Anticipate snow patches through mid-summer on this north-facing slope. The trail continues around the lake and arcs NE down valley in a high-alpine landscape. It drops steadily to a swale-like meadow (4.25 miles : 11,680'), and undulates ruggedly above to the South Fork Pass Trail split (4.95 miles : 11,635'). Expect sections of faint, shifting trail that can be hard to follow with lingering snow or after washouts from here to the lake. The South Fork Pass Trail breaks NE on a mild climb to South Fork Pass (5.25 miles : 11,725'), which is fairly subtle and perhaps only obvious once you begin a steep descent into the valley below. Travel moderates in the narrow upper valley back to treeline and the top of Deadman Gulch (6.25 miles : 11,305'). Here it drops 270' in just .3 miles to an abrupt opening in the central valley, and spills into a vast meadow cut by the South Fork (6.55 miles : 11,015'). Take note of this transition point, as the trail between forest and meadow can be hard to find on the return. The trail all but fades in this damp open space, with faint tracks marked sparingly by cairns on the far west side down to Deadman Lake (6.8 miles : 10,965'). Deadman Lake is more of a glorified marshy pond, but the meadows around it are a virtual playground, and major thoroughfare for wildlife. The trail continues about 3.5 miles to its northern terminus.",157.95
16,Independence Lake and Lost Man Lake,Aspen-Snowmass,5.5,11506,12482,976,4,True,"Independence Lake and Lost Man Lake are located 1.8 miles and 2.75 miles from Independence Lake Trailhead on Highway 82, 17.3 miles east of Aspen in the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness. These stunning high-alpine lakes are separated by Lost Man Pass (12,810'), which offers simultaneous views of the lakes and a line of summits in the Collegiate Peaks. Both lakes are located on the 8.9 mile Lost Man Loop Trail, which can be accessed from two points on Highway 82: The Lost Man Campground or Independence Lake Trailhead. Note the Lost Man Loop is not a true loop - it begins/ends at these trailheads, which are 4 miles apart. To complete the loop you'll either need to arrange a shuttle or walk the road. Both starting points have merit - the following description begins at Independence Lake Trailhead for the most direct route: The trail begins at treeline up to the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness Boundary and split for Linkins Lake, a short and worthwhile side trip (.15 miles : 11,615'). It crosses the Roaring Fork (.48 miles : 11,735') and keeps a steady pace up the east side between Twinning Peak (east) and Geissler Mountain (west). The trail gradually bends NE to the open shore of Independence Lake (1.8 miles: 12,487'). Independence Lake fills a broad alpine bench under Lost Man Pass with a large tarn .1 mile away that's easy to reach and worth exploring. The trail follows the level shore before turning sharply up to Lost Man Pass (2.35 miles : 12,810'). Lost Man Pass spans a divisive ridge between the Roaring Fork headwaters (south), and Lost Man Creek drainage (north). Views are outstanding, with hike-able routes that branch off to Geissler Mountain and points on the Continental Divide. The trail tilts steeply down switchbacks that cross short sections of talus to Lost Man Lake (2.75 miles : 12,482'). Anticipate lingering snow through mid-summer on this north-facing slope. Lost Man Lake is larger than Independence, but only it's east side is open. The trail continues by the lake into high alpine meadows in the upper valley, and to its west terminus at Lost Man Campground. Views down Lost Man Creek valley are worth a look, and a great place to scan high slopes and ridges for mountain goats, bighorn sheep and elk.",157.95
17,Linkins Lake,Aspen-Snowmass,1.2,11506,12008,502,2,True,"Linkins Lake (12,008') is located .6 miles from Independence Lake Trailhead off Highway 82 in the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness. It fills a steep-walled bowl along the south ridge of Geissler Mountain. This short, family-friendly hike offers a high alpine lake experience with minimal effort. The trail begins at treeline up to the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness Boundary and split for Linkins Lake (.15 miles : 11,615'). The Linkins Lake Trail breaks left and winds steeply up the west valley wall to the east side of Linkins Lake (.6 miles : 12,008'). The lake is fairly large with a gentle open shore ideal for fishing and exploration. Social trails lead over the lake to outcrops with great aerial views of the basin, and to scrambling routes that continue up the Geissler ridge. It's also quite easy to explore high alpine meadows over the north shore. Consider continuing on to Independence Lake (12,487'), a moderate 1.65 miles from the split to Linkins Lake along the Lost Man Loop.",157.95
18,La Plata Peak,Aspen-Snowmass,8.6,10170,14361,4191,5,True,"La Plata Peak (14,361') is located 4.3 miles from La Plata Peak Trailhead off Highway 82 in the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness. It's the 5th highest peak in Colorado, distinguished by a broad west flank, bulky-rock summit and exceptional views that extend deep into the Collegiate Peaks and from Twin Lakes to Independence Pass. The hike begins across a deep gorge in South Fork Lake Creek and joins La Plata Creek, which it follows into the upper valley before splitting up La Plata's west flank on a strenuous push to the north ridge. It continues on a variously steep and rugged path across sections of sharp talus to the summit. The main route is non-technical, reasonably well-marked and minimally exposed, though you may find the descent equally time consuming while negotiating loose rock on steep grades. La Plata Peak Trailhead is located on Highway 82, 14 miles west of the Highway 82 - Highway 24 junction in Twin Lakes (28.1 miles east of Original Street in downtown Aspen). The trail officially begins .3 miles down South Fork Lake Creek Road (FDR 391), which is private. You must walk the road to access the trail (left side of road). Distances here begin from the main trail access point on South Fork Lake Creek Road: The trail begins on private land and quickly meets a bridge over a scenic gorge in the South Fork. Cross and bear right into an undulating aspen forest to a makeshift log bridge (.55 miles) that leads to mud reinforced steps at the base of La Plata Gulch (.8 miles : 10,355'). The steps funnel into La Plata Gulch and beside steep cascades on La Plata Creek. The trail climbs 655' in just .7 miles into the wide, U-shaped upper valley (1.5 miles : 11,010'). It levels briefly before edging (left) up the west flank of La Plata on very steep, tightly wound switchbacks that gradually lengthen and straighten through 12,000' (2.4 miles). Travel moderates across grassy benches before another steep push to the north ridge with great views (east) down La Plata Basin (3.0 miles : 12,750'). The trail climbs steadily to the base of a large talus slope where you'll find several cairn-marked routes but no great options (3.5 miles : 13,468'). Pick your way through steep, uneven rock until finding a decent track through 14,000' (3.95 miles). The trail continues on a rugged but straight-forward path to a false summit (4.25 miles) and across a rocky ridge to La Plata Peak (14,361'). You may continue on a Class 3 scramble along Ellingwood Ridge, or improvise your return down La Plata Basin to join Lake Creek and follow well-defined social trails back to the trailhead to make a loop.",143.9
19,Grizzly Lake,Aspen-Snowmass,7.3,10610,12523,1913,3,True,"Grizzly Lake (12,523') is located 3.65 miles from Lincoln Creek Road in the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness. It fills a steep-walled cirque carved from the base of Grizzly Peak (13,988') just west of the Continental Divide. This relatively moderate hike follows long stretches of alpine meadow beside Grizzly Creek until veering away across high alpine terraces on the final ascent. The lake is hemmed by tight cirque walls but tall knolls on the open side have nice vantages over the lake and valley. Fishing is also quite good at Grizzly Lake, which sees lighter traffic than others near Aspen due to the difficult drive up Lincoln Creek Road: The trail climbs 365' in just .45 miles to an expansive meadow where travel moderates for the next 1.7 miles across big, open slopes over Grizzly Creek. This fast stretch features great views across the valley, ideal camping terrain and wildflowers that rival any during their mid July - August peak. It arcs SE down to the creek, crosses to the west side (2.15 miles : 11,435') and steepens toward the west valley wall. The trail edges away from the creek before turning sharply west and leveling across an alpine terrace from 3.0 - 3.35 miles (12,080 ' - 12,290'). This abrupt deviation from the creek may seem counter-intuitive and hard to read with snow cover. Carry a good map and be patient with route finding past the 2.15 creek crossing. Look for elk and goat in high alpine meadows and craggy walls on this attractive segment. The trail heads straight across to a switchback notched in the west valley wall (3.35 miles : 12,290'), which turns south on a steep run to Grizzly Lake (3.65 miles : 12,523'). Level ground is limited on the shore, but tall knolls with clear social trails are easy to scale with great views across the basin, valley and meadows you pass from 3.0 - 3.35 miles.",196.6
20,New York Creek Trail,Aspen-Snowmass,8.2,10095,12273,2178,4,True,"New York Creek Trail runs 4.1 miles from Lincoln Creek Road to the Continental Divide in the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness. It continues over a 12,273' pass to the Goodwin-Greene Hut (west), Bowman Creek Trail (south) and Ptarmigan Lake (southeast). This lightly used trail follows New York Creek through attractive forests and meadows into a large alpine basin below Difficult Peak (12,925') and winds steeply up to the Continental Divide. Views are exceptional, and you'll likely see more elk than people in these big open spaces. Anticipate vague sections, especially above treeline and over the pass. Cairns mark the final push to the Pass, which can be confused for well-worn game tracks following similar routes: The trail begins on a flat bank along Lincoln Creek, which you'll immediately cross. This ford is wide and can be difficult during peak runoff. Once over there's another small channel of stagnant water that also must be crossed to regain the trail, hidden by dense willow just beyond the water. Punch through the willow and find a clear trail (.15 miles) that crosses a small meadow and rises steadily on an old roadbed. Keep straight at a large cairn (.6 miles : 10,355') and emerge in a meadow where the trail arcs steeply up to the aqueduct service road (.95 miles : 10,580'). Turn right on the road and follow it past an S-curve over Brooklyn Gulch (1.3 miles) to a sign pointing left off the road back onto the trail (1.45 miles : 10,605'). It enters a verdant, moss-draped forest and crosses the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness Boundary at 1.55 miles (10,645'). The trail rises steadily in dark timber above New York Creek to a crossing at 2.25 miles (10,830'), then cuts across large meadows to the west side of the valley. Travel steepens across open slopes with good views across stream-cut meadows below. It gradually bends away into a high subalpine forest and crosses left over a stream (3.22 miles : 11,475'). There are many good places to camp in this idyllic stretch of forest. The trail clears treeline (3.5 miles : 11,710') into a vast alpine basin framed by the Divide and Difficult Peak (12,925'). The trail can be faint and cairns may be hard to pick out - a map is helpful to stay on track and avoid well-defined animal tracks that use similar routes to reach the Divide. The trail generally angels SE through rolling tundra on the final push to the Pass on the Continental Divide (4.1 miles : 12,273'). Views extend down New York Creek, south down Bowman Creek, deep into the Collegiates and across much of the Elk Mountains. Improvised travel is fairly easy on the Divide, but consider your route carefully across delicate tundra vegetation.",183.85
21,Tabor Pass,Aspen-Snowmass,7.9,10285,12462,2177,3,True,"Tabor Pass is located 3.95 miles from Lincoln Creek Road in the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness. The Tabor Creek Trail runs through long stretches of alpine meadow with several large tarns up to the pass. While grades are generally moderate, the trail fades considerably past 2.75 miles and route finding may be necessary in the upper valley. Have a map and general understanding of the route before setting out. Cairns offer guidance, but are inconsistently placed and can be difficult to spot in open tundra. Fortunately the trail tends to follow the best available terrain and most intuitive route, which greatly helps navigation. Snow cover will compound any challenges, so consider waiting until mid-summer if uncomfortable in these conditions. GPS points given here are useful, but your on-trail experience may differ slightly. Visitors will enjoy expansive alpine landscapes, abundant flowers and great views to and from the pass. Tabor Lake and Truro Lake are accessible from the trail and pass (respectively) with good route finding skills: The trail immediately crosses Lincoln Creek and rises steeply beside a deep gulch to aqueduct road (.3 miles : 10,590'). Cross the road and pass the Wilderness Boundary (.35 miles) to Tabor Creek (.62 miles : 10,735'). It crosses the creek, turns south and moderates across broad grassy slopes with an exceptional array of flowers (1.0 miles : 10,975'). The trail runs fast through open slopes and patchy forest before rising steeply past 2.0 miles to the edge of treeline (2.5 miles : 11,605'). It pushes past treeline on rugged, brushy terrain into a big meadow in the upper valley where the trail abruptly fades (2.75 miles : 11,790'). Note this important point for the return hike. Follow cairns left toward the center of the valley to the first of three large tarns (2.93 miles : 11,492'). A steep wall juts into the valley past the largest tarn, which you needn't scale. Simply follow cairns and/or best available terrain (which is fairly smooth and level) around this large feature and hook back to the east side of the upper valley once past it (3.15 miles : 11,930'). Here the upper valley tapers with a clear look at the pass. Stay high on the east valley wall and follow mild-moderate contours to a cairn at the base of the pass (3.8 miles : 12,255'). The trail clarifies and winds up through loose rock to Tabor Pass (3.95 miles : 12,462'). Views from the pass down Tabor Creek are exceptional, though somewhat confined to peaks and the immediate basin on the north side. It's easy to drop to a large tarn at the top of Galena Creek, and continue down a short distance for bigger views of the drainage.",187.65
22,Lost Man Loop,Aspen-Snowmass,8.9,10545,11506,961,4,False,"The Lost Man Loop runs 8.9 miles up Lost Man Creek to Lost Man Lake and Lost Man Pass (12,810'), then drops to Independence Lake and follows the Roaring Fork River to Independence Lake Trailhead on Highway 82. This versatile trail features two high alpine lakes, Lost Man Pass, expansive meadows and connections to Midway Pass and South Fork Pass. The Lost Man Loop can be accessed from two points on Highway 82: The Lost Man Campground and Trailhead or Independence Lake Trailhead. Note the Lost Man Loop is not a true loop - it begins/ends at these trailheads, which are 4 miles apart. You'll either need to walk the road (not advised) or have a two-car shuttle to connect the trailheads. The two starting points offer very different experiences, especially if returning the way you came. The Independence Lake Trailhead provides a shorter, more direct route to the lakes and pass, while the Lost Man Trailhead sends you on a long, gradual climb to the same destinations. Desired distance and difficulty will help you decide which starting point is best. The following description begins at Lost Man Trailhead and travels clockwise: Follow signs left from the trailhead for Lost Man Creek and Midway Creek. The trail arcs to the Midway Creek Trail split (.35 miles : 10,620') and rolls to the edge of Lost Man Reservoir (.55 miles : 10,610'). It levels past the reservoir across broad, open meadows to the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness Boundary (1.5 miles : 10,693') and a wide creek crossing, which can be fairly difficult during peak runoff (1.86 miles (10,785'). Once across it resumes a fast pace through intervals of meadow and patchy forest along and above the creek. Grades steepen past 2.5 miles to another creek at 2.9 miles (11,045'), a narrow but swift crossing aided by elevated, slippery logs. The trail rises steadily through an expanding valley and veers steeply up the west wall to the South Fork Pass Trail split (4.1 miles : 11,622'). Take a few steps up this trail to see peaks that frame adjacent drainages. The Lost Man Loop curls SE from South Fork over a big bend in the valley with great views up and down the route. Grades are moderate but the trail is rugged, brushy and muddy as you undulate close to the damp, swale-like valley floor. It gradually rises back through potentially faint but well-traveled meadows and terraces (5.0 miles : 11,725') to Lost Man Lake (6.1 miles : 12,482'). The trail skirts the lake and switchbacks steeply up rugged, loose rock to Lost Man Pass (6.55 miles : 12,810'). Lost Man Pass spans a divisive ridge between the Roaring Fork headwaters (south), and Lost Man Creek drainage (north). Views are outstanding, with hike-able routes that branch off to Geissler Mountain and other points on the Continental Divide. The trail drops off the pass into broad meadows surrounding Independence Lake (7.1 miles : 12,487'). Independence Lake fills a wide alpine bench with a large tarn .1 mile away that's easy to reach and worth exploring. It continues on a steady descent between Twinning Peak (east) and Geissler Mountain (west) to a bridge over the Roaring Fork River (8.42 miles : 11,735'), split for Linkins Lake (8.75 miles : 11,615') and Independence Lake Trailhead on Highway 82 to complete the loop (8.9 miles : 11,506').",164.0
23,Midway Pass,Aspen-Snowmass,8.0,10545,11841,1296,3,True,"Midway Creek Trail runs miles 8.7 miles from Lost Man Trailhead on Highway 82 to Hunter Flats in the Hunter - Fryingpan Wilderness. Midway Pass (11,841') is located 4 miles from the trailhead between Coleman Creek drainage (south) and Midway Creek drainage (north). Midway Pass is a compelling and lightly used alternative to the Lost Man Loop, which leaves from the same trailhead and accesses Lost Man Lake and Independence Lake. The pass-approach features expansive alpine meadows with panoramic views across the Maroon Bells, Collegiate Peaks and Hunter-Fryingpan wilderness areas. There are several accessible summits off the main trail, and these big open spaces are particularly good for seeing elk and mountain goats. Note Midway Pass is not the highest point on the trail, and the divide it spans is fairly subtle. Additionally, some maps imply the distance is ~3.1 miles vs. 4.0 miles. This could be attributed to the highest point on the trail, not the actual point where drainages divide: Follow signs left from the trailhead for Lost Man and Midway Creek. The trail arcs around a marshy area to the Midway Creek Trail (.35 miles : 10,620'), which splits left and climbs fast on methodical switchbacks. It rises steadily to the Hunter - Fryingpan Wilderness Boundary (1.4 miles : 11,465') where grades moderate in a thinning forest. Small clearings on this leg offer good camping terrain. The trail emerges from treeline (2.15 miles : 11,760') and crosses willow-covered meadows to the edge of a scenic pond framed by the Collegiate Peaks and Elk Mountains (2.7 miles : 11,970'). It steepens up a wide slope to the trail's high point (3.02 miles : 12,112'), a good turnaround point if limited by time or weather, and split-off point for reaching the 13,033' summit above. The trail continues NW from the crest on a gradual descent with great views over Coleman Creek to Midway Pass (4.0 miles : 11,841'). This last mile can be faint, though cairns help and terrain naturally funnels you in the correct direction. The pass might not be obvious and is only marked by a large cairn and short wood pole, but newly-found views down Midway Creek will confirm your arrival. Terrain remains fairly mild for some time down Midway Creek, and Midway Lake is only 1 mile away as the crow flies from Midway Pass.",164.0
24,4 Pass Loop,Aspen-Snowmass,26.8,9580,12465,2885,5,True,"The 4 Pass Loop runs 26.8 miles through the heart of the Elk Mountains and Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. This challenging trek scales four passes over 12,400' with stunning views and long stretches of open alpine travel.  West Maroon Pass (12,465') Frigid Air Pass (12,405') Trail Rider Pass (12,415') Buckskin Pass (12,462') Whether tackled as a trail run or a more leisurely 2-3 day trip, advance knowledge of the route will maximize time and ensure a safe and enjoyable outing. While the distance is not overwhelming, steep climbs at high elevation with unpredictable weather are considerable factors. Carry a detailed map to track progress, anticipate passes and target campsites. There are many designated sites along the way, with freedom to improvise under guidelines of the wilderness area (see details below). Contact the Aspen Ranger District (970.925.3445) for the latest conditions, closures, bear canister requirements and other useful tips before heading out. The following description begins at Maroon Lake and travels clockwise on the 4 Pass Loop: 1. MAROON LAKE - WEST MAROON PASS | 6.45 miles 9,580' - 12,465' @ Pass | 2885' net gain | 3115' total gain The trail begins on the north side of Maroon Lake before rising away into thick aspens that break across an open rock field to the West Maroon Creek - Maroon Snowmass Trail split (1.7 miles : 10,110'). Bear left to begin clockwise travel on the loop. The trail levels around Crater Lake to campsites on the far end. It bends S-SW above the inlet and undulates over rockslides at the base of Maroon Bells. It moves quickly up valley and crosses east over West Maroon Creek, where water can be swift during peak runoff (3.65 miles : 10,515'). The trail rises steadily past treeline and crosses back to the west side through tall swaths of willow (4.5 miles : 10,905'). Travel steepens in short intervals through 5.45 (11,525') miles into broad meadows below the pass. It climbs 940' in the last mile on a ramp-like trail to West Maroon Pass (6.45 miles : 12,465'). The pass spans a small notch in the SW corner of the headwall, with great views down West Maroon Creek and the East Fork drainage on the Crested Butte side. 2. WEST MAROON PASS - FRIGID AIR PASS | 2.55 miles 12,465' - 12,405' @ Pass | 60' net loss | 745' total gain This is the shortest pass-to-pass section of the loop, and arguably the easiest. The trail drops from West Maroon Pass to the split for Crested Butte and Frigid Air Pass (7.25 miles : 11,735'). It rises NW across high alpine meadows above the East Fork drainage, a notably airy stretch with great views over the popular thru-hike route to Crested Butte. The trail splits right at a sign for Frigid Air Pass, and the unmarked left fork heads toward Hasley Basin (8.6 miles : 12,035'). Travel steepens on the last .15 miles up to Frigid Air Pass (9.0 miles : 12,405'). Panoramic views include Maroon Bells and Fravert Basin, where you'll spend the next 4.7 miles. 3. FRIGID AIR PASS - NORTH FORK CUTOFF TRAIL | 4.7 miles 12,405' - 10,295' | 2100' net loss | 165' total gain The trail drops quickly from Frigid Air Pass into Fravert Basin, gradually moderating through expansive alpine meadows topped by red hued walls. It reaches treeline at 10.35 miles (11,425'), and edges close to North Fork Creek through brushy intervals with numerous designated campsites. This fast moving, nondescript section is ideal for making up time if not camping in the area. It passes the last site at 11.7 miles (10,870') before dropping steeply beside a waterfall into a wide, level meadow cut by oxbows of the North Fork (12.05 miles : 10,530'). It enters a cluttered forest before emerging in another meadow that funnels you east across the creek (12.9 miles : 12,440'). The trail remains level above a kinetic section of creek to the Geneva Lake - North Fork Cutoff Trail split (13.7 miles : 10,295'). This is the lowest point of the loop (not counting the 1.7 mile leg from Maroon Lake to Crater Lake). 4. NORTH FORK CUTOFF TRAIL - TRAIL RIDER PASS | 2.55 miles 10,295' - 12,415' @ Pass | 2120' net gain | 2210' total gain This strenuous section climbs above the North Fork through aspen groves and grassy slopes to a second split for Geneva Lake (14.8 miles : 11,390'). Note the trail gains 1095' in just 1.1 miles to this junction. The trail veers right and narrows into a steep gulch, then rises away on switchbacks that moderate across rolling alpine meadows below Trail Rider Pass. The trail skirts a large pond (15.4 miles : 11,710'), the primary water source if camping in the area (small outlying ponds can dry out). The reprieve ends with a 705', .85 mile climb to Trail Rider Pass (16.25 miles : 12,415'). Views of the route leading up are exceptional, and even more so down the east side of Snowmass Lake. 5. TRAIL RIDER PASS - SNOWMASS LAKE | 2.1 miles 12,415' - 10,980' | 1435' net loss | 55' total gain The trail drops steeply from Trail Rider on winding switchbacks with expanding views over Snowmass Lake and the formidable peaks above it: Snowmass Peak (13,619'), Hagerman Peak (13,841') and Snowmass Mountain (14,092'). It transitions quickly from alpine meadows to willow mats and treeline at 17.75 miles (11,510'). Conditions are rugged over washed out sections and talus leading to the Geneva Lake Trail - Maroon Snowmass Trail split (18.35 miles : 11,040'). Snowmass Lake is a short walk from here (18.37 miles : 10,980'). 6. SNOWMASS LAKE - BUCKSKIN PASS | 3.9 miles 10,980' - 12,462' @ Pass | 1482' net gain | 1670' total gain The trail rises out of the Snowmass Lake basin into a thick forest, then drops to a wide opening along Snowmass Creek. The trail loses clarity leading to a bridge over the creek (19.55 miles : 10,860'); pay close attention on this braided approach. Once over travel gradually steepens on long, methodical switchbacks to treeline, where views open across the Snowmass Creek drainage back to Snowmass Lake (20.05 miles : 11,575'). Grades steepen on a winding course through high alpine meadows before relaxing on the final run to Buckskin Pass (22.25 miles : 12,465'). Buckskin Pass is the most spacious of the four, a long saddle with rangy views across the Elk Range and Snowmass Lake basin (north), and Maroon Bells and Pyramid Peak (south). Look for goats on adjacent slopes and ridges before making the final descent. 7. BUCKSKIN PASS - MAROON LAKE TRAILHEAD | 4.6 miles 12,462' - 9,580' | 2882' net loss | 155' total gain The trail descends winding switchbacks through flower-carpeted slopes to the Willow Lake Trail split (23.9 miles : 11,745'). It narrows into Minnehaha Gulch and a stream crossing to the east side at 24.7 miles (11,030'). It drops quickly through the gulch back to the Maroon Snowmass - West Maroon Creek Trail split (25.1 miles), where you began clockwise travel on the loop. Retrace your steps back to Maroon Lake on a variously rocky-rooted path to complete the 4 Pass Loop (26.8 miles : 9,580').",224.566666667
25,Aspen to Crested Butte,Aspen-Snowmass,10.45,9580,10448,868,4,True,"The West Maroon Creek Trail joins the West Maroon Pass Trail to form a 10.45 mile thru-hike from Aspen to Crested Butte. This feature-filled route is highlighted by Maroon Lake, Crater Lake, West Maroon Pass and arguably one of the finest wildflower displays in Colorado. The east-west hike begins at Maroon Lake (9,580') outside Aspen and climbs 2,885' to West Maroon Pass (12,465'), then drops through high alpine meadows and moderates above East Fork Crystal River to East Fork of West Maroon Trailhead on the Crested Butte side. See below for shuttle and transportation details to each trailhead. This is a very busy trail corridor with access to all points on the 4 Pass Loop, Snowmass Lake, Willow Lake, Hasley Basin and climbing routes to Maroon Bells and Pyramid Peak. Expect heavy traffic in both directions, especially on summer weekends. Get an early start to experience lighter crowds and avoid storms while coming over the pass. Much of the trail is exposed, even when below treeline. Anticipate variable weather conditions throughout the day, and as you gain and lose elevation: The trail begins on the north side of Maroon Lake before rising away into thick aspens that break across an open rock field to the West Maroon Creek - Maroon Snowmass Trail split (1.7 miles : 10,110'). Bear left for Crater Lake and West Maroon Creek. The trail levels around Crater Lake with access to 11 designated campsites. It bends S-SW above the inlet and undulates over rockslides at the base of Maroon Bells. It moves quickly up valley and crosses east over West Maroon Creek, where water can be swift (3.65 miles : 10,515'). The trail rises steadily through patchy forest and crosses back to the west side through tall mats of willow (4.5 miles : 10,905'). Travel steepens in short intervals through 5.45 miles (11,525') and the last of treeline into broad meadows below the pass. It climbs 940' in the last mile on a ramp-like trail to West Maroon Pass (6.45 miles : 12,465'). The pass spans a small notch in the SW corner of the headwall with great views down West Maroon Creek and the East Fork drainage on the Crested Butte side. The trail drops from West Maroon Pass on steep switchbacks to the Frigid Air Pass split at the top of the East Fork drainage (7.25 miles : 11,735'). The West Maroon Pass Trail splits left, bends W-SW and moderates through high alpine meadows to the north side of the valley. These sunny south-facing slopes support one of the most prolific wildflower displays in Colorado, which continues virtually uninterrupted for the next 3 miles. You'll pass an unmarked split at 8.45 miles (11,155') which breaks north for Hasley Basin, a compelling diversion that scales a pass and drops into the North Fork drainage to join the 4 Pass Loop. Travel eases on a steady descent (save one steep rise from 9 - 9.5 miles) through the open valley until the forest re-constitutes at the Wilderness Boundary (10.12 miles : 10,590'). It drops in short intervals to the East Fork of West Maroon Trailhead in Schofield Park (10.45 miles : 10,448'). Crested Butte to Aspen Return Hike The hike from Crested Butte to Aspen is considered easier because it's shorter, starts higher and follows a relatively smooth path all the way up to the pass. The descent to Maroon Lake is particularly rocky with several stream crossings and potential for deep mud in places. The trail runs 4.0 miles and 2,017' up to the pass, and 6.45 miles down to Maroon Lake. Total elevation gain is approximately 2,460' in this direction.

26,Buckskin Pass,Aspen-Snowmass,9.2,9580,12462,2882,4,True,"Buckskin Pass (12,462') is located 4.6 miles from Maroon Lake in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. It's one of nine passes over 12,000' in the wilderness, and arguably easiest to reach. Buckskin spans a divisive ridge between Minnehaha Gulch (east) and the Snowmass Creek drainage (west). Views are among the most inclusive on this trail network, highlighted by the Maroon Bells, Pyramid Peak, Snowmass Lake, Snowmass Mountain and distinct red-white hues of the Elk Range. Unlike other passes that thread fragile crags between valleys, Buckskin is fairly broad with room to explore. Scan nearby ridges for mountain goat, which are common in this area. Visitors will enjoy high alpine landscapes and iconic Colorado scenery on the hike to Buckskin Pass: The Maroon Snowmass Trail begins on a level path up the north side of Maroon Lake to the Scenic Loop split (.3 miles). It rises away in thick aspens that break across an open rock field on the valley floor (1.2 miles : 10,070'). Pick your way through talus back into the forest, where it crests and drops to the West Maroon Creek Trail split (1.7 miles : 10,110'). Crater Lake is a quick and worthwhile excursion from this point. The Maroon Snowmass Trail steepens considerably over Crater Lake and bends NW up Minnehaha Gulch. Enjoy great morning light on the Bells and Sleeping Sexton on this rapid climb. The trail crosses a rocky stream channel (2.95 miles : 11,030') to a meadow, then funnels up a shallow gulch that opens over treeline (3.45 miles : 11,480). Note camping is not permitted in these meadows. The trail resumes a steep, sinuous course to the Willow Lake Trail split (3.8 miles : 11,745'), where it breaks NW on a twisting path up flower-covered slopes to Buckskin Pass (4.6 miles : 12,462').",224.566666667
27,Crater Lake,Aspen-Snowmass,3.6,9580,10076,496,2,True,"Crater Lake is located 1.8 miles from Maroon Lake in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. Crater Lake formed as glaciers retreated and left flat, open spaces where water collected in a process called glacial benching. Both Maroon and Crater lakes contain notably high nutrient levels, which contributes to algae growth that creates a unique blue-green hue. Brook, rainbow and brown trout naturally occur in these lakes and their tributaries (Maroon Lake is stocked and also contains Colorado River cutthroat). This short but scenic hike is ideal for families or those with limited time. Visitors will enjoy mild grades, abundant wildflowers and great fishing on the hike to Crater Lake: The Maroon Snowmass Trail begins on a level path up the north side of Maroon Lake to the Scenic Loop split (.3 miles). It continues above the inlet area into thick aspens that break across an open rock field on the valley floor (1.2 miles : 10,070'). Pick your way through talus back into the forest, where it crests and drops to the West Maroon Creek Trail split (1.7 miles : 10,110'). Bear left to Crater Lake (1.8 miles : 10,076'). The West Maroon Creek Trail levels around the north shore to the open outlet area before steepening up-valley. This wide area is cut by lazy oxbows of West Maroon Creek, and is worth exploring. The trail continues on to West Maroon Pass, part of the venerable 4-Pass Loop and most popular thru-hike route to Crested Butte.",224.566666667
28,Snowmass Lake,Aspen-Snowmass,17.0,9580,10980,1400,5,True,"Snowmass Lake is located 8.5 miles from Maroon Lake in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. It lies at treeline in a massive cirque framed by Snowmass Peak (13,619'), Hagerman Peak (13,841') and Snowmass Mountain (14,092'). It's among the largest alpine lakes in the Wilderness, and one of many highlights on the 4-Pass Loop. Snowmass Lake is accessible from either end of the 16.8-mile Maroon Snowmass Trail; the following description begins at Maroon Lake and scales Buckskin Pass (12,462'), the more popular and arguably most scenic route. This travel corridor sees heavy traffic so expect crowds, honor campfire restrictions and reduce impact by staying on trails, using established sites and leaving no trace of your visit: The trail begins on the north side of Maroon Lake to the Scenic Loop split (.3 miles). It rises away into thick aspens that break across an open rock field on the valley floor (1.2 miles : 10,070'). Pick your way through talus to a crest and drop to the Maroon Snowmass - West Maroon Creek Trail split (1.7 miles : 10,110'). Crater Lake is a quick and worthwhile excursion from the split. The Maroon Snowmass Trail steepens over Crater Lake and bends NW up Minnehaha Gulch. Enjoy great morning light on the Bells and Sleeping Sexton on this rapid and rugged climb. The trail crosses a rocky stream channel (2.95 miles : 11,030') to a meadow, then funnels up a shallow gulch that opens over treeline (3.45 miles : 11,480). Note camping is not permitted in these meadows. Buckskin Pass is now in sight, and Willow Pass is concealed in the upper valley. The trail resumes a steep, sinuous course to the Willow Lake Trail split (3.8 miles : 11,745'), where it breaks NW on a twisting path up flower-covered slopes to Buckskin Pass (4.6 miles : 12,462'). Buckskin Pass spans a divisive ridge between Minnehaha Gulch (east) and the Snowmass Creek drainage (west). Views are terrific with room to maneuver and examine distinct rock types of the Elk Range. Scan nearby ridges for mountain goat, which are common in this area. Snowmass Lake is now visible with a bird's eye view of the long route leading to it. The trail drops NW from the pass on more moderate grades back into treeline (5.9 miles : 11,575'). Scenery enjoyed from the pass is now lost on a business-like descent to a wide, marshy section of Snowmass Creek. It reaches the far-end of this oxbow-cut space and turns sharply left on a bridge over the creek (7.25 miles : 10,860'). It skirts the opening and rises on switchbacks into thick timber, undulating to consecutive splits for Geneva Lake (8.28 and 8.38 miles). A map is useful here, as you now have options for reaching the lake or skipping it altogether. Follow signs in each case to Snowmass Lake (8.5 miles : 10,980'). The lake is nearly .75 miles long and several hundred yards wide, with iconic peaks and vertical walls framing the west side. The east side is ringed by patchy forest and easier to explore. Backpackers seeking privacy should consider backtracking, or continuing north on the Maroon Snowmass Trail to nice sites just below the basin. ONE-WAY ELEVATION PROFILE | TRAIL MAP",224.566666667

This stunning pass is the most commonly used route for thru-hikers between Aspen and Crested Butte, and the first encountered when traveling clockwise on the 4-Pass Loop. The West Maroon Creek Trail rises steadily between iconic peaks into the capacious upper valley, where grades steepen on a ramp-like path etched in the west wall to the pass: The trail begins on the north side of Maroon Lake to the Scenic Loop split (.3 miles). It rises away into thick aspens that break across an open rock field on the valley floor (1.2 miles : 10,070'). Pick your way through talus to a crest, and drop to the Maroon Snowmass - West Maroon Creek Trail split (1.7 miles : 10,110'). Bear left and level up the west side of Crater Lake to the first group of campsites on the far end (2.0 miles : 10,110'). The trail bends S-SW over the inlet and undulates across rockslides at the base of Maroon Bells, with high points offering great views back at Crater Lake and Pyramid Peak (3.0 miles : 10,295'). It moves quickly up valley under the Len Shoemaker Ridge and crosses east over West Maroon Creek (3.65 miles : 10,515'). Water can be swift during peak runoff, but is generally not an obstacle. The trail rises steadily before clearing the balance of treeline with your first full view of the red-hued headwall and pass in the SW corner (4.45 miles : 10,880'). It crosses West Maroon Creek back to the west side (4.5 miles : 10,905'), weaving through tall willow patches and flower-filled glades. Scan the upper valley for wildlife as you progress - you'll likely see anything that moves in this big, open space. Travel steepens in short intervals through 5.45 (11,525') miles into an idyllic landscape under the pass. Views are astonishing as it climbs 945' in the last mile on a ramp-like trail to West Maroon Pass (6.45 miles : 12,465'). Be mindful of footing on this narrow, potentially unstable approach. The pass spans a small notch in the SW corner of the headwall with exceptional views across West Maroon Creek valley, and down East Fork drainage on the Crested Butte side.

30,Willow Lake,Aspen-Snowmass,12.4,9580,11795,2215,5,True,"Willow Lake is located 6.2 miles from Maroon Lake in the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness. It lies just above treeline in a stunning alpine basin east of Willow Pass (12,572'). While the lake is exceptional, the hike itself is equally compelling. It follows the Maroon Snowmass Trail with iconic backdrops to the meadows under Buckskin Pass, where the Willow Lake Trail splits for Willow Pass and an airy descent to the lake. This segment is not connected to most other backpacking routes in the area, and sees lighter traffic. It's also one of the few over-and-back pass hikes that can be completed in a day, though time management is important with an exposed climb on the return. Visitors will enjoy open landscapes, light crowds and a chance to explore Willow Creek, one of the longest and least visited drainages in the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness: The trail begins on the north side of Maroon Lake to the Scenic Loop split (.3 miles). It rises away into thick aspens that break across an open rock field on the valley floor (1.2 miles : 10,070'). Pick your way through talus up to a crest and drop to the West Maroon Creek Trail split (1.7 miles : 10,110'). Crater Lake is a quick and worthwhile excursion from this point. The Maroon Snowmass Trail steepens considerably over Crater Lake and bends NW up Minnehaha Gulch. Enjoy great morning light on the Bells and Sleeping Sexton on this rapid climb. The trail crosses a rocky stream channel (2.95 miles : 11,030') to a meadow, then funnels up a shallow gulch that opens in a gorgeous alpine setting (3.45 miles : 11,480). Note camping is not permitted in these meadows. Buckskin Pass is in sight, but Willow Pass is hidden by a ridge. The trail resumes a steep, sinuous path to the Willow Lake Trail split (3.8 miles : 11,745'), which breaks north on similar terrain with stunning views down valley. Scan these high slopes and meadows for goat, sheep and elk. It levels briefly on the rim of a large bowl in the upper valley (4.2 miles : 12,075'), crosses a stream and arcs up the bowl's right side to the base of the pass (4.55 miles : 12,315'). Here it climbs 257' in just .15 miles to Willow Pass, a small notch in the craggy walls between drainages (4.7 miles : 12,572'). The pass offers rangy views over the route leading to it, and across Willow Creek basin. Willow Lake and large outlying ponds can also be seen from the pass. The descent is initially steep, but gradually moderates through high alpine meadows rife with flowers. It drops gently to the East Snowmass Trail split (5.5 miles : 12,005'), a faint point marked by a low-lying sign that can be obscured by snow or brush. The trail continues on a rolling, narrow-cut path that may lose clarity on the final approach, though the lake's location is never in question. It laces through krummholz-topped knolls to the north side of Willow Lake (6.2 miles : 11,795'), an expansive area that begs exploration. Scale the south wall for great aerial views, explore the outer ponds, or continue down valley for a great chance to see wildlife in this seldom-visited drainage.",224.566666667
31,Haystack Mountain,Aspen-Snowmass,12.9,8408,12206,3798,5,True,"Haystack Mountain (12,206') is located 6.45 miles from Maroon Snowmass Trailhead in the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness. Its broad, flat summit tops a divisive ridge between the Capitol Creek and West Snowmass Creek drainages, just north of a saddle under Mount Daly (13,305'). This challenging and lightly used trail rises through steep intervals of aspen and alpine meadows to the saddle (11,752'), where you'll branch off and improvise .35 miles and 454' up to the summit. Postcard-like meadows span the saddle between Haystack and Mount Daly, with exceptional views that include Mount Sopris, Capitol Peak and the Maroon Bells. Wildflowers and wildlife are particularly abundant in this rich alpine expanse. Crossing Snowmass Creek can be difficult through mid-summer, and portions of the trail are vague with several unmarked forks at critical points. Good fitness and navigation skills are necessary. Lingering snow may compound any difficulty you encounter. Alternatively you can reach West Snowmass Trail from the Capitol Creek and Nickelson Creek trails, with simpler navigation but equally challenging climbs. Contact the Aspen Ranger District for current road and trail conditions, which may influence your starting point and route: The trail rises over Snowmass Falls Ranch through tall aspen to a second cattle gate where the forest opens with views of Snowmass Creek (1.1 miles : 8,648'). It levels on a high bank to the West Snowmass Trail split (1.45 miles : 8,638'), which switchbacks down to Snowmass Creek (1.52 miles : 8,600'). The creek is wide and runs swiftly through mid-summer; poles can be useful on this ford. Once across follow National Forest signs through a big meadow with views up to Clark Peak (13,568'). Note this is private property, so it's important to stay on the designated trail. It crosses the meadow into bands of aspen where you'll keep straight past several bisecting paths to another cattle gate (1.9 miles : 8,780'). Travel intensifies past the gate on a rugged, shifting path under a tall aspen canopy. Keep left at a fork (2.0 miles) where grades steepen to a high bank over a tributary (2.5 miles : 9,235'). It levels and arcs across the drainage before climbing steeply again to a small meadow (3.18 miles : 9,595'). Travel eases to another meadow (3.45 miles : 9,710') and crosses the base of a steep slope to an unmarked fork (3.85 miles : 9,957'). The left fork drops into a large meadow along West Snowmass Creek where you can pick up an informal route leading to its source at Moon Lake. The right fork quickly fades, leaving few good options. The following description and distances from this point assume you're able to find a creative route to the next point where the trail clarifies .3 miles away. Note this is a direct line, so your actual travel distance may be longer. Cut through heavy brush and steep slopes to regain the trail on a high clearing (4.15 miles : 10,230'). The trail here is narrow and may be overgrown by tall brush. Once on track it steepens to another unmarked fork (4.48 miles) - stay right. The trail runs along the base of an open slope before turning up on a steep, winding climb to the Nickelson Creek Trail split (4.95 miles : 10,825'), a welcome sign confirming you're on track. Travel briefly moderates past the split across steep meadows with great views of Mount Daly. It rises quickly through alpine glades and pockets of spruce to a meadow in the upper basin where the trail fades. Follow a cairn (5.5 miles : 11,295') and faint track across the meadow to regain the trail, which resumes steep, winding travel past treeline to the Pass (6.1 miles : 11,752'). The pass spans a broad meadow with great views down Capitol Creek, the Daly-Capitol Peak ridge line and (right) up to Haystack. Break off the trail here and head north on a .35 mile - 454' scramble up to Haystack Mountain (6.45 miles : 12,206'). The scramble is steep but rock-free and easy to find an efficient route. The summit is broad and flat with incredible views that extend from Mount Sopris to Maroon Bells. Tread lightly across these delicate tundra meadows. Mount Daly (13,305') stands prominently across the pass with Capitol Peak (14,130') nudging higher just behind it.",216.05
32,Pierre Lakes,Aspen-Snowmass,16.4,8408,12174,3766,5,True,"The Pierre Lakes occupy a massive, rocky basin below Capitol Peak (14,130') and Clark Peak (13,568') in the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness. No maintained trail reaches the lakes, however a strenuous and navigationally challenging route follows Snowmass Creek and Bear Creek up to the basin. Only experienced hikers should attempt this route. The hike can be tackled in five parts: The Maroon Snowmass Trail to Snowmass Creek (GPS points 1-8) Snowmass Creek ford into the Bear Creek drainage (GPS points 9 - 10) Unmaintained route up Bear Creek to the waterfall (GPS points 10 - 12) Scaling the waterfall (GPS points 12 - 16) Waterfall up to the Pierre Lakes (GPS points 16 - 26) Distances and GPS points provided here are only a guide and individual routes will vary. The route generally follows an old trail of which parts are still clear or intuitively followed. Other segments follow cairns though you'll likely find multiple sets. Navigation is much easier past treeline where you can simply trace the creek. Arguably the biggest challenge is the waterfall on Bear Creek. It's steep and requires some Class-3 scrambling and bushwhacking through cheese grater-like brush. It can take 1 - 2 hours (each way) to clear the waterfall. Cairns offer guidance but are easily lost and difficult to follow. This description runs up the right side of the waterfall, and acknowledges but can't attest to possible routes up the left side. Travel is generally rugged once off the main trail with heavy brush and long sections of rock, especially leading up to the waterfall and across the Pierre Lakes basin. These sections slow travel and should factor in to your schedule. Visitors will enjoy stunning scenery throughout that few people have a chance to see: Maroon Snowmass Trail to Snowmass Creek (GPS points 1-8) The trail rises through tall aspen to views over Snowmass Creek (1.1 miles : 8,648'). It levels on a high bank to the West Snowmass Trail split (1.45 miles : 8,638') and runs fast on mild grades in a thick aspen forest. You'll generally want to cross Snowmass Creek as close to Bear Creek as possible to avoid unnecessary bushwhacking on the far side, but it's difficult to discern this drainage from Copper Creek (approximately .12 miles before Bear Creek). Some trip reports suggest there's a bridge over Snowmass Creek near the ideal cross-point, but it's hard to find and its condition can't be verified. One efficient point is approximately 3.7 miles up the Maroon Snowmass Trail. This approximate location will place you near the mouth of Bear Creek on the north side where you'll find the designated route. Snowmass Creek ford into the Bear Creek drainage (GPS points 9 - 10) Leave the main trail and head down to Snowmass Creek (approx. 3.7 miles : 9,125'). Snowmass Creek is voluminous, especially during runoff. Prioritize safe crossing over location - once over the best available terrain will naturally funnel you into the Bear Creek drainage and up the north side. Some trip reports suggest crossing before or just after Copper Creek. It seems unnecessary to cross that early unless volume is prohibitive near Bear Creek. A decent track leads from Snowmass Creek into the drainage where navigation is fairly straightforward up to the waterfall. Unmaintained route up Bear Creek to the waterfall (GPS points 11 - 13) The unmaintained route runs along Bear Creek through intervals of meadow, open rock, tall brush and timber (4.3 mile mark). Terrain is uneven but grades are generally moderate with easy navigation along the creek. Raspberries are abundant across open slopes. Be mindful of bears, especially where visibility is limited. You'll reach a big opening in the valley at the edge of a long rock slide from which you'll see the waterfall (4.9 miles : 9,640'). Cross this rocky section to a swath of willow between you and the base of the falls (5.2 miles : 9,850'). You can climb up / around this rugged (and deceptively long) segment, but it's advisable to stay low and punch through to the far side where you'll find cairns leading up the right side of the waterfall (5.25 miles : 9,850'). Scaling the waterfall (GPS points 13 - 16) Cairns head straight up with Class-III scrambling in places. You'll likely lose one route and pick up another by following natural lines and best available terrain. Dense brush can present a bigger challenge than rock or pitch on this scramble - the best way is often a hard-nosed punch right through it. The route climbs 600'+ across boulders, open ledges and brush before tilting back down to glades above the waterfall (note the waterfall isn't 600' tall, but the route leads you higher to avoid cliffs). Head toward the creek where a good path will soon emerge (5.55 miles : 10,560'). Mark your transition point from brush to glades because it's difficult to find on the return. The waterfall descent is equally challenging and time consuming. Routing is especially important on the return, as it's possible to get cliffed-out and backtracking is difficult. Waterfall up to the basin (GPS points 16 - 26) Once above the waterfall travel moderates to another long, open rockslide (6.0 miles : 10,570'). The valley is flat here but the center is cluttered by willow, forcing you up the rock. Head straight across to find a grassy track that leads to a well-marked creek crossing (6.4 miles : 10,790'). This is where Bear Creek forks and the route crosses the north fork to a steep ridge between forks (the north fork leads to the lower lakes, and the south fork leads to the largest lake). It follows cairns up this steep ridge while favoring the south side and losing sight of the north side (GPS points 19 - 22). Cairns seem to disappear as timber thins and big meadows along the south fork of Bear Creek emerge below (7.1 miles : 11,570'). Both routing and terrain become much easier as you pass treeline (7.2 miles : 11,525') into alpine meadows along the south fork of Bear Creek. Follow the creek to a steep rocky ridge (8.1 miles), which you'll scale to reach the Pierre Lakes basin (8.2 miles : 12,174').",216.05
33,Blue Lake (Aspen-Snowmass),Aspen-Snowmass,4.4,10758,12435,1677,3,True,"Blue Lake (12,435') is located 2.2 miles from North Fork of Lake Creek Trailhead off Highway 82 in the Mount Massive Wilderness. It's part of the area's last private in-holding that was acquired by the Wilderness Land Trust in 2012 and transferred to the National Forest Service. Blue Lake fills a steep-walled bowl just east of the Continental Divide below Twinning Peak (13,711'). This moderate hike follows the North Fork of Lake Creek before splitting off on a steep climb through treeline to the lake. It fades on the final approach but routing is intuitive across open terrain. Visitors will enjoy light crowds, great fishing and quick access to high alpine landscapes on the hike to Blue Lake: The trail begins on a flat road bed that narrows up to a stream at the Mount Massive Wilderness Boundary (.71 miles : 11,018'). This is Blue Lake's outlet, which you'll follow to the lake. Cross the stream and immediately begin looking for a faint fork on your left (.75 miles : 11,025'). Bear left at this sparingly marked point, just past which travel clarifies on a very steep, twisting climb up the right side of the creek. It gains 700' in .5 miles before clearing treeline and moderating in a big alpine valley below the lake (1.25 miles : 11,715'). The trail rises up the right (east) side of the valley and gradually loses clarity (1.8 miles : 12,140'). Cairns offer guidance and you'll likely find multiple sets - some lead higher up the valley wall and others run low closer to the outlet stream. Both options are viable though the higher route tends to be drier. The final approach levels across big meadows to Blue Lake (2.2 miles : 12,435'). Soft alpine grasses surround the open SE side with gentle slopes that offer great aerial views across the basin.",148.316666667
34,North Fork Trail,Aspen-Snowmass,8.1,10795,12438,1643,3,True,"The North Fork Trail runs 4.05 miles through a broad, glacially carved valley to Fryingpan Pass (12,438') in the Mount Massive Wilderness. The pass spans a rocky saddle on the Continental Divide under Deer Mountain between the Fryingpan River and North Fork Lake Creek drainages. The approach travels up a classic U-shaped valley topped by 13,000' peaks and a large tarn just below the pass. There are many good places to camp and fish in the lower valley before a strenuous climb up the headwall. The North Fork Trailhead is located 4.5 miles east of Independence Pass on Highway 82 between Aspen and Leadville, just far enough away from each to be overlooked. Visitors will enjoy lighter crowds and stunning alpine landscapes on the North Fork Trail: The trail begins on a flat road bed that narrows up to a stream and the Mount Massive Wilderness Boundary (.71 miles : 11,018'). Hop the stream and continue on mild grades between thin bands of timber and the North Fork of Lake Creek. It levels from 1.3 - 2.4 miles across broad meadows under steep, open slopes ideal for glassing wildlife. The trail weaves through willow leading to the west branch of the creek, which you'll cross (right) and rise up a subtle ridge between branches of the North Fork (2.4 miles : 11,540'). Note that after a brief time the route will follow the east branch up to the pass. Grades steepen through treeline along the east branch to a big grassy basin under the headwall (3.3 miles : 11,880'). Follow cairns to the base, where you'll climb nearly 500' in .5 miles to a large tarn just below the pass (3.85 miles : 12,378'). The cairn-marked trail may lose clarity across this rocky basin, but it's a clear and easy scramble from here to Fryingpan Pass (4.05 miles : 12,438'). Views down both valleys are exceptional, and an unmaintained but intuitive route continues into the Fryingpan drainage to join a maintained trail at Fryingpan Lakes. Deer Mountain (13,761') stands prominently over the pass, with a similar basin and tarn between it and Mount Champion (13,646') that can be reached with modest effort.",148.316666667
35,Viewline Trail to Skyline Ridge Trail,Aspen-Snowmass,8.1,7905,8514,609,3,False,"Sky Mountain Park covers 2500 acres of newly designated open space between the Owl Creek and Brush Creek valleys in Snowmass. 30 miles of existing and in-development trails run through 5 natural vegetation types: Mountain Shrublands (57%) Sagebrush Shrublands (22%) Shale Barrens (9.5%) Riparian Corridors (2.7%) Aspen-Douglas Fir Forests (1.75%) This diverse composite offers critical winter range and migration habitat for elk and mule deer. Badger, mountain lion, bear and scores of birds have also been documented in the Park. Several trailheads access Sky Mountain Park with many connection points for creating loops, out-and-backs and reaching Aspen.  The Viewline Trail joins the Skyline Ridge Trail to form an 8.1 mile and-and-back route along the Park's high central ridge with big views that range from Mount Sopris to Aspen Highlands. Clean singletrack and mild grades suit mountain bikes, runners and families of all abilities. Dawn and dusk travelers stand a good chance of seeing wildlife in this active area. The following description accesses the Viewline Trail from Highline Trailhead on Highline Road, just steps up from the roundabout in Snowmass Village. There's no parking at the trailhead - use free parking at Town Center and walk .1 mile to the trailhead: The Highline Trail winds .23 miles up to a Map Board and 3-way fork. The Viewline Trail (middle fork) splits up and to the right of the Ditchline Trail and winds tightly through tall crowns of gambel oak and mountain mahogany. Mount Daly (13,305') and Capitol Peak (14,130') stand prominently over Snowmass Village with expanding views across the valley and Elk Mountains. The Viewline Trail rises quickly on a sinuous path that gradually straightens to a crest and the Deadline Trail - Skyline Ridge Trail junction (1.95 miles : 8,595'). The Skyline Ridge Trail continues straight and dips down across broad sage flats dotted with paintbrush, lupine, phlox and balsamroot. It rolls to the base of a steep knoll (3.0 miles : 8,565') and wraps NE to a high thin ridge with great views over Owl Creek. Look for elk that gather in these pastoral meadows from April - late June. It winds steeply down then undulates moderately along the ridge to the Airline - Cozyline Trail split (3.95 miles : 8,475'). The Skyline Ridge Trail continues to its terminus at Cozy Point on Radar Road above the Aspen Airport (4.05 miles : 8,514'). Those seeking longer and more varied routes on the return can split off on the Cozyline-Cozy Point Loop or Daedline Trail, both of which will return you to the Viewline and Skyline Ridge Trails.",202.666666667
36,Rim Trail,Aspen-Snowmass,7.9,8615,8545,-70,3,True,"The Rim Trail - South runs 3.95 miles up and along the north valley wall of Snowmass Village from Divide Road to the Rim Trail - North Trailhead on Lake Wildcat Way. It climbs 600' in the first 1.3 miles to a high point over the valley, then moderates along a diversely vegetated ridge with panoramas across Snowmass Village and the Roaring Fork Valley. Runners and mountain bikers will enjoy smooth single track the entire way, and option to extend travel on the Rim Trail - North. The Rim Trail - South is a great alternative to the Government Trail and its connectors when closed for elk calving mid-May to late-June: The trail begins on a moderately steep climb through scrub oak and sage with rapidly expanding views over Snowmass Village. It winds methodically up to the trail's highest point (1.3 miles : 9,212') with stunning views of Mount Daly (13,305') and Capitol Peak (14,130'). Ignore spurs branching right just before gaining the ridge, as they'll join the main trail but eschew this amazing backdrop. The trail turns sharply east off the apex and dips into pockets of aspen and fir on the north side of the ridge. Note contrasting ecological compositions as you toggle between north and south slopes from this point on. Travel moderates on a rolling descent through intervals of aspen, conifer and scrub oak through 2.5 miles (8,885') where views of Wildcat Reservoir open to the north. The trail edges back to the spine (3.0 miles : 8,718') and splits at a sign for easy and difficult terrain (3.48 miles : 8,535'). The right (easy) fork narrows across the south slope and rejoins the left fork just before reaching the terminus on Lake Wildcat Way (3.95 miles : 8,545'). The Rim Trail - North picks up on the far side of the road.",208.35
37,Sunnyside - Shadyside Loop,Aspen-Snowmass,11.2,7845,10061,2216,3,True,"The Sunnyside Trail joins the Shadyside Trail to form an 11.2 mile lollipop loop up and around the summit of Red Mountain in Aspen. The Sunnyside Trail climbs 1900' in 3 miles up the SW flank to reach the loop, which runs 5.2 miles through long intervals of aspen and mixed conifers just below the summit. This busy trail system features stunning views across the Roaring Fork Valley from Mount Sopris to Ajax Mountain, with several iconic peaks in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness in the backdrop. Smooth, neatly cut singletrack offers mountain bikes and runners ideal conditions on this ecologically varied route. Distance Note: There's a connector trail that cuts a 'chord' across the Loop that can shorten distance and difficulty. This connector trail is also called 'Sunnyside'. Distance discrepancies between sources can in part be attributed to custom routing. The following description travels counter-clockwise on the loop, taking each trail segment in full: The trail rises from Cemetery Lane to a cairn leading right (.35 miles) - don't miss this important split. It continues on long-leg switchbacks in a scrub oak ecosystem with views that extend across the Snowmass, Buttermilk, Aspen Highlands and Ajax Mountain ski areas. The trail crosses a road (left) and quickly departs right at 1.33 miles (8,530'). It climbs methodically through diminutive brush until passing a radio tower (2.4 miles) and leveling across an aspen-ringed glade (2.55 miles : 9,405'). It rises back into a cluttered forest that opens upon reaching the Shadyside Trail split and beginning of the loop (3.0 miles : 9,752'). Keep right on the Sunnyside Trail for counter-clockwise travel. The Sunnyside Trail heads SE on level contours below the summit across aspen-studded slopes to the Sunnyside connector trail (3.5 miles : 9,740'), which you can take to shorten the loop. Long stretches of aspen mix with spruce and fir along mild grades for the better part of the next two miles. The trail gradually bends NE to a small clearing at the Shadyside - Repeater Road Trail junction (5.52 miles : 10,010'). Signs point left onto the 4WD Road for Shadyside, which quickly departs (right) back onto singletrack. Follow signs for the Shadyside Trail closely. The Shadyside Trail drops in a thick forest to a boggy pond and Sunnyside Trail split (6.55 miles : 9,770'), which as before can be taken to shorten the loop. The Shadyside Trail continues descending through nondescript conifers that conceal large openings in the forest. Take a few steps off trail to explore these interesting spaces. It gradually curls S-SW with partial views to a marked fork (7.4 miles : 9,445') - anticipate this sudden split which leads up and to the left. The trail undulates on a S-SW heading back to the first Sunnyside - Shadyside split to complete the loop (8.2 miles : 9,752'). Retrace your steps on the Sunnyside Trail to the trailhead on Cemetery Lane (11.2 miles : 7,845').",205.566666667

The first lake fills a steep walled bowl that forms Prince Creek; the second lies .2 miles away in a level, more accessible basin. This feature-filled trail passes through mountain shrublands, high meadows and tall aspen stands to the lakes. It continues 4 miles and 2800' up to Mount Sopris, and many hikers will basecamp at Thomas Lakes en route to the summit. Camping and campfires are allowed in 13 designated sites within 1/4 mile of the lakes. Dispersed camping is otherwise permitted in outlying areas of the White River National Forest and Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness (see below for details). This is a busy trail corridor, especially on summer weekends - arrive early to secure choice campsites at Thomas Lakes: The trail climbs steadily in mixed timber to a gate (1.15 miles : 9,230'). It bends south and levels across open shrubland slopes with great views down W. Sopris Creek and out to Hay Park. These sunny slopes are a good place to see flowers and anything moving about. Bear right at the Hay Park - Thomas Lakes Trail split (1.7 miles : 9,370') and rise through open space to an elevated meadow with great views of Mount Sopris (2.0 miles : 9,595'). The trail enters a tall aspen forest and moderates to a string of glades (2.9 miles : 9,850') that open to big meadows along Prince Creek (3.2 miles : 9,980'). It crosses Prince Creek and passes between a pond and large clearing (3.5 miles : 10,135') to the Maroon Bells Wilderness Boundary and first Thomas Lake (3.8 miles : 10,197'). The trail forks here to designated campsites - follow signs for Mount Sopris to reach the second Thomas Lake (4.0 miles : 10,248'). The first lake is ringed by rugged talus that can limit exploration. Improvise across the outlet to open-rock shores where you'll find few people, excellent views and raspberries popping through the talus. The second lake fills a level (albeit rocky) basin with good access for anglers and more room to explore.",209.866666667
39,Weller Lake,Aspen-Snowmass,0.9,9363,9555,192,2,True,"Weller Lake (9,555') is located .45 miles from HWY 82 in the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness. It occupies a rocky basin fed by drainages on the slopes of New York Peak (12,811') and Mt Shimer (12,340'). This short trail crosses the Roaring Fork River and winds through a mixed aspen-pine forest to the basin (.45 miles). Here it fades amid rugged terrain, but established social trails rise above the lake's east side and drop to the open inlet area (.75 miles). This last segment braids in many places, but all lead to the same place and navigation is intiutive with the lake in sight. Weller Lake is ideal for families and anglers, and typically accessible by late spring through early winter. Autumn colors are quite good, with especially nice views of aspen-covered slopes along the the Highway 82 - Roaring Fork Valley.",175.066666667

This short but steep route begins off Highway 82 and joins the Continental Divide Trail up Little Willis Gulch to a saddle between Quail Mountain (13,461') and Mount Hope (13,933'). Views extend from Twin Lakes into the Collegiate Peaks, and both Quail Mountain and Mount Hope are challenging but fairly straight-forward walk-ups (Hope is decidedly more difficult). The CDT continues south from Hope Pass down Sheep Gulch to County Road #390. Visitors will enjoy diverse forests, cascading creeks and big alpine landscapes on the way to Hope Pass: From the parking lot, cross the bridge over Lake Creek and head straight on a path through tall brush. Ignore social trails that branch off along the creek. Follow signs for Big and Little Willis Gulch #1471 that lead over beaver ponds to the Upper Twin Lake split (.37 miles : 9,435'). Here grades steepen through young aspen on a long SE arc into the gulch (1.0 miles : 9,835'). Travel moderates to a bridge (1.35 miles : 9,893') where it joins the CDT and steepens considerably in a tall, mixed forest beside the creek. There are many cascades on this stretch, though you'll have to work to see the most kinetic ones. The trail climbs 385' from the bridge to the Little Willis - Big Willis Gulch Trail split (1.8 miles : 10,278'); bear left up Little Willis and resume steep climbing that gradually eases in a wide, flat piece of forest above the gulch (2.5 - 3.0 miles : 10,910' - 11,200'). It steepens back in a high, patchy forest before emerging through treeline in a postcard-like basin in the upper valley (3.65 miles : 11,722'). Travel moderates across alpine meadows with a great look at Mount Hope and a scenic tarn across the valley. The trail takes a winding but efficient route up the west flank of Quail Mountain to Hope Pass (4.5 miles : 12,508').",139.266666667

It lies in a deep, tightly hemmed basin capped by Mount Hope (13,933'), Ervin Peak (13,531'), Mt Blaurock (13,616') and Rinker Peak (13,783') at the head of Willis Gulch.  The route begins off Highway 82 and joins the Continental Divide Trail (CDT) before splitting off on the Big Willis Gulch Trail to the lake. Willis Lake can be overlooked for Hope Pass, a seminal point on the Leadville 100 racecourse accessed by the CDT. It's no less compelling with long stretches of varied terrain and open space in the upper valley. The lake is uncommonly long and ringed by contrastingly steep rockslides, gentle slopes and muddy flats. Fishing is quite good with reports of cutthroat up to 18"". Anticipate rugged and overgrown sections on the last two miles, but nothing dissuasive. Note distance and max elevation figures here only reflect travel to the lake; the Big Willis Gulch Trail never actually drops to the lake and instead continues high up the valley wall to mine remains before fading out. A short scramble down is required to reach the shore: From the parking lot, cross the bridge over Lake Creek and head straight on a path through tall brush. Ignore social trails that branch off along the creek. Follow signs for Big and Little Willis Gulch #1471 that lead over beaver ponds to the Upper Twin Lake split (.37 miles : 9,435'). Here grades steepen through young aspen on a long SE arc into the gulch (1.0 miles : 9,835'). Travel moderates to a bridge (1.35 miles : 9,893') where it joins the CDT and steepens considerably in a tall, mixed forest beside the creek. There are many cascades on this stretch though you'll have to work a bit to see the most kinetic ones. The trail climbs 385' from the bridge to the Little Willis - Big Willis Gulch split (1.8 miles : 10,278'). The Big Willis Gulch Trail breaks SW and moderates to stream crossings at 1.92 and 2.3 miles. It funnels up a tight gulch and climbs 340' in just .35 miles to a meadow (3.02 miles : 10,933') where the landscape opens to a long rockslide that takes a few minutes to cross (3.2 miles : 11,045'). Once over it begins rugged, shifting intervals through head-high willow that limit visibility. Watch your feet and trail closely on these obfuscated sections. Breaks in the willow pass through attractive meadows where you'll find cabin remains (3.95 miles : 11,350'). The trail clears treeline into a level expanse between a pond and the flank of Rinker Peak (4.45 miles : 11,590'). There's good camping terrain around the pond, though you'll have to punch through rocky willow mats to reach it. The trail rises up the west valley wall to great views over the lake basin and on to mining remains at the head of the valley. There's no designated route down to the lake and you'll have to improvise, but it's better to drop sooner than later because the further you go the more difficult it is to descend to Willis Lake (5.15 miles : 11,742'). Note your departure point from the main trail, as it can be difficult to find on the return.",139.266666667
42,Woody Creek Trail,Aspen-Snowmass,18.4,8785,10443,1658,5,True,"The Woody Creek Trail runs 9.2 miles through diverse forests across the Woody Creek and Hunter Creek drainages. This long and lightly used trail follows Woody Creek to its south fork headwaters, then rolls over a steep ridge and drops to the Hunter Creek side. The Woody Creek Trail is primarily used to access the Marcy and McNamara huts and few travel it's entire length, which arguably goes nowhere in particular. Visitors will find a great deal of solitude once past connections for these huts. While no one landmark stands out the trail features verdant forests, large meadows and great views across the Hunter-Fryingpan and Maroon Bells wilderness areas from high points along the way. There's good camping terrain along Woody Creek and wildlife is active in these fecund forests, especially during shoulder seasons. The trail is vague in many places but intuitively followed with cut logs and tree notches providing reliable guidance: The trail begins in a narrow corridor hemmed between talus-strewn walls and the creek. Remain alert for bears as you pass through overgrown brush and concentrations of currant, thimbleberry and raspberry. Sight may be limited here during peak summer growth. It crosses to the north side of Woody Creek (.4 miles) and passes the Wilderness boundary (.8 miles) on a rugged path that gradually clarifies to another crossing at 1.5 miles (9,425'). It rises to the Spruce Creek Trail split (1.55 miles : 9,505') and steepens away on a clearer path above the creek. Travel now moderates for long stretches in a notably verdant forest to a stream crossing that leads you up the south fork of Woody Creek (3.65 miles : 10,295'). Once over the trail loses clarity and turns sharply up the side of a boulder field; pay close attention on this vague, shifting segment. It crosses the creek again (3.95 miles - now just the smaller south fork) and regains clarity up to an expansive meadow (4.25 miles : 10,748'). This is a great place to see wildlife and fine turnaround point for day hikes. It skirts the meadow before turning back into thick timber and climbing steeply above it on a SE arc near the upper valley rim. The forest gradually thins and breaks at a meadow (5.55 miles : 11,395'); follow cairns straight across to find the trail on the far side. A good path continues on a challenging push through treeline to the divisive ridge between drainages (5.95 miles : 11,592'). It fades on the open ridge but cairns lead across and down the south (Hunter Creek) side where it clarifies in a reconstituted forest. The trail drops steeply to Deer Park (7.05 miles : 11,010') and undulates past this large meadow into dry, thinly-treed south-facing slope. Downhill travel eases with great views of the Elk Mountains to the Hunter Creek Trail junction at the Slab Park meadows (9.2 miles : 11,443'). The north (right) fork of the Hunter Creek Trail leads up to Bald Knob (11,092') and the McNamara Hut, and continues on a primitive path back to the Woody Creek Trail to form a loop. Only experienced hikers should attempt this route.",224.25
43,Anne U White Trail,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,3.2,6040,6530,490,1,True,"The Anne U. White Trail is named in memory of Anne Underwood White, a local writer and open space advocate who donated 20 acres for the creation of this trail. The Anne U. White Trail follows Four Mile Canyon Creek through a narrow canyon hemmed by thick timber and steep rock walls. Ponderosa, fir, aspen, cottonwood, willow and maple line this lux riparian corridor, which yields a diverse collection of summer wildflowers and autumn colors. Perennial water, flowers, abundant natural edibles and shelter attract hummingbirds, deer, fox, coyote, bobcat bear and mountain lion. Mild grades welcome families, dogs, trail runners and winter recreation: The trail heads west from the parking area and quickly joins the creek, rising nominally to the first of several easy crossings (.55 miles : 6,165').

Trail Map | Photos Barr Lake attracts over 350 migratory and resident avian species including white pelicans, great blue herons, cormorants, egrets, bald eagles, golden eagles and several types of hawks and falcons. Barr Lake is also home to coyote, badger, fox, rabbit, mule deer and white tail deer - one of few places in the Denver front range where these two commingle. Before settlement, Barr Lake was a deflation basin used by buffalo as a wallow. In the 1880s a dam was built on its north side, and water was diverted from the South Platte River to fill the newly formed Oasis Reservoir. After years of degradation, a massive flood in 1965 diluted pollution and gave the state a chance to restore its natural purity and habitat. Colorado purchased surrounding lands in 1975 and designated it a State Park. Several trails begin at the Barr Lake Nature Center: the Lake Perimeter Trail is the park's longest, an 8.9 mile multi-use loop around the lake and Wildlife Refuge. Its level, graded track is ideal for runners, families and winter recreation. The following description travels clockwise on the loop: Cross the bridge and turn left into the Wildlife Refuge. The Lake Perimeter Trail runs level around the lake's southeast shore through tall rows of cottonwood. Skip the first Fox Meadow Trail spur in favor of the second, a quick detour that leads to a wildlife viewing blind and spotting scope (1.05 miles : 5,128'). The Gazebo Boardwalk Trail spur (1.3 miles : 5,125') leads out to the lake's marshy shore with excellent views of a rookery (breeding ground) through a spotting scope. The main trail continues along the perimeter over an inlet stream, (2.25 miles : 5,126'), just past which is a bald eagle nesting and viewing area. The trail eases up the northwest shore and exits the Wildlife Refuge Boundary (4.5 miles : 5,106'). Here the woods and wetlands yield to a more suburban setting, and the trail follows a gritty train track from 4.75 miles - 5.15 miles. You'll reach the Barr Lake Dam in 5.9 miles (5,122') and have the option of walking along a berm (the Crest Trail) or beside it on the main path. See Worth Noting below for important information and restrictions on this section. The Barr Lake Dam forms the lake's northeast shore, stretching 1.35 miles from end to end. Once over (7.25 miles : 5,124'), it curls south and traces the shore past the boat ramp (7.8 miles) and Pioneer Trail spur (8.25 miles) back to the Nature Center to complete the loop (8.9 miles).",34.4

48,Boulder Reservoir Loop,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,5.25,5260,5260,123,1,True,"The Boulder Reservoir is a 700-acre multi-use recreation area and water-storage unit. It's surrounded by short grass prairie and wetlands framed by the Boulder foothills. The Boulder Reservoir supplies 20% of Boulder's drinking water, 80-90% of which comes from the Boulder Feeder Canal and 10-20% from seasonal creeks and ditches. It typically fills by June and draws down to half its 13,270 acre-feet capacity by September. The facility includes beach volleyball courts, boat rentals, a seasonal swim beach, restrooms, showers, horseshoe pits, 13 picnic tables and ramp access for boats. A series of paved, dirt and gravel road-trails form a contiguous 5.25 mile loop around the reservoir, deservedly one of Boulder's most popular running, cycling and bird watching destinations. Connections with the Eagle Trail and Coot Lake extend routing options through this biologically rich area. There are four access points to the Boulder Reservoir Loop - the following description begins at the 51st Street - West Portal Entrance and travels clockwise: The trail begins on a rolling, graded dirt road with one steep hill to the Eagle Trailhead lot (.8 miles : 5,258'). Sunflowers and thistle line this section, an area busy with prairie dogs, snakes, rabbit, coyote and raptors. The road continues northeast through wetlands (east) and open space (west) up to the 55th Street Trailhead (1.75 miles : 5,232'). Enter the lot and bear east on a narrow gravel path set just above the reservoir. Look for osprey, herons, egrets, ducks and pelicans in the nearby marsh. The trail steepens (2.1 miles) on a short switchback that levels over the main canal (2.35 miles : 5,245'). It widens on a dirt road with three access points to Coot Lake before curling west (2.9 miles : 5,228') to the reservoir's North Dam. Here it turns sharply south (3.25 miles : 5,220') along the flat dam wall, a fast-moving section with panoramas across the reservoir, foothills and back range. The road-trail turns southwest over the South Dam wall (3.85 miles : 5,222'), another fast section with comparable views. It merges with a hilly paved road on the reservoir's south shore (4.45 miles : 5,234') that rolls past the marina, boat house and swimming beach to complete the loop at the West Portal Entrance Station (5.25 miles).",40.45

Coot Lake and its adjacent marshes are one of Boulder County's richest wetland communities and bird watching destinations. Loons, grebes, ducks, gulls, blackbirds, red tail hawks, kestrels and the namesake coot are common, while ospreys and herons (summer) and bald eagles (winter) are familiar seasonal residents. A 1.2 mile groomed loop circles Coot Lake and its outlying marshes, ideal for families, anglers, runners and avid birders. A short pier at the trailhead and rocky jetty are good places to drop lines or take a closer look at activity on and below the surface. Marshes on the west side are comprised of small channels, ponds and peat mounds, prime feeding and nesting grounds for local wildlife. Willow and cottonwood stands on the perimeter are excellent places to see roosting raptors, especially in the winter. The Coot Lake Loop shares a short piece of trail with the Boulder Reservoir Loop, which provides additional access points and options for longer outings and aquatic activities.",41.45

These versatile 4-season trails are open to dogs, bikes and equestrians.  Connections with the Boulder Reservoir Loop, North Rim, Left Hand and Cobalt trails form longer routes through bucolic open space. You can access the Eagle-Sage Loop from the Eagle Trailhead on 51st street, or the Boulder Valley Ranch Trailhead on Longhorn Road. The following description begins at the Eagle Trailhead and travels counter-clockwise: The Eagle Trail heads west on level track to the Sage Trail split (.5 miles : 5,295'). The Sage Trail bends northwest through open space, a good place to see prairie dogs, rabbit, coyote and raptors. You'll pass a sparingly marked split atop the first of several rolling hills for the North Rim Trail (1.0 miles : 5,320'), which leads north to Neva Road. The Sage Trail continues past a private ranch, through a cattle gate (1.35 miles : 5,330') and southwest to the Boulder Valley Ranch Trailhead (1.65 miles : 5,370'). Here you'll find connections with the Cobalt and Left Hand trails, the former leading west to a web of short trails between Boulder Valley Ranch and Highway 36, the latter due north to Left Hand Reservoir and Neva Road. The Sage Trail continues south over low rolling hills lined by cottonwood at the base of a steep mesa. Look for owls in these sprawling treetops. The Sage rejoins the Eagle Trail at 2.35 miles (5,371'), were it begins a long descent with terrific views over the reservoir vicinity.

The lollipop loop, 3 miles of which run along graded service roads that parallel North St. Vrain Creek, is ideal for trail running, winter activities, families, and anglers. The trail begins on a smooth service road, rising nominally along North St. Vrain Creek while skirting Longmont Reservoir, which at first glance appears little more than a wide, slow moving section of the creek. The grade increases to the Sleepy Lion Trail junction (.75 miles : 6,135'). The Sleepy Lion Trail turns south and rises sharply, weaving quickly through fir, ponderosa, cacti patches, and rocky outcrops. Views north of Button Rock Mt (8,417') are quite good as you climb. The trail exits the forest and levels into a large, rolling meadow (1.25 miles : 6,385'). This brief but attractive segment is a good place to find wildlife. Seasonal and occasionally seen are bighorn sheep that were re-introduced in the 1980s. Naturalists are studying this population's migration patterns, believed to use these lands as wintering and lambing grounds. The trail climbs steeply out of the meadow through a nondescript forest to the Button Rock Trail junction (1.75 miles : 6,625'). A little maneuvering yields terrific views across Ralph Price Reservoir and distant summits of Mt Meeker (13,911') and Longs Peak (14,259'). Those seeking a longer hike may consider adding the 4-mile roundtrip Button Rock Trail, highly recommended for its spacious meadows and solitude. The Sleepy Lion Trail continues unevenly for a short spell before bending north and dropping down to the Ralph Price Reservoir Dam base and service road (2.7 miles : 6,253'). Bear right on the service road, which crosses the dam outlet and realigns with North St Vrain Creek for an easy 2 mile return to the parking lot.

The trail is named for Ceran St. Vrain (1802 - 1870), a fur trader, politician and settler who established several trading posts and military forts along this creek and the South Platte River. This mild trail leads through pristine upper-montane forests, an inclusive ecological transition zone of lodgepole pine, spruce, fir and aspen. The riparian corridor it follows supports bigtooth maple, thin leaf alder, box elder and willow, which combine to produce brilliant autumn colors. Summer flowers thrive along the creek, notably columbine, wild rose and the prized Fairy Slipper Orchid. Visitors will enjoy good trail conditions, mild grades, easy stream access, desirable backcountry camping locations and excellent fishing: The trail begins over a long bridge with good up and down-stream views. Once over it turns north and undulates mildly up the creek's west bank with little net elevation loss to its unofficial terminus at the 801-252 Jeep road split (1.92 miles : 8,105'). The trail is generally clear and well-padded from layers of fallen pine needles, but negotiates a few high, narrow ledges on the first half mile that are tricky when iced over. Beyond that, it travels easily through intervals of mixed pine, narrow-walled passages, and broad stream shoulders. Though campsites are unmaintained, many are well-established and easy to find. No sign marks the trail's end, however it suddenly widens at the 801-252 4WD Jeep fork. A good map will lead you up Road 801 to another series of dirt road connections and unmarked trail spurs, one of which scales the summit of Miller Rock (8,646').",74.7

The Mesa Trail (2.75 miles), Bear Canyon Trail (1.85 miles) and Bear Peak West Ridge Trail (1.9 miles) form an ecologically varied route through ponderosa forests, meadows and high ridges.  This route is longer but may be preferable to more direct and challenging ones through Gregory, Fern, and Shadow canyons: From Chautauqua Park, head south on Blue Bell Road to the Mesa Trail (.6 miles : 6,010). Bear left and begin a steady climb through tall ponderosa stands to the Kohler Mesa Trail split (1.15 miles : 6,250'). The Mesa Trail levels across open contours with good views of the eastern plains. It dips and rises past the Skunk Canyon Trail junction to a steep, twisting descent on reinforced mud-stairs (1.85 miles). Once down the trail rises back through open slopes with good views of Bear Peak to the Mallory Cave Trail junction (2.05 miles : 6,207'). Travel quickens through undulating forest and drops to a service road (2.4 miles). Bear right on the service road for a steep climb to the Bear Canyon Trail split (2.75 miles : 6,262'). The Bear Canyon Trail is rugged in places but generally keeps a steady, moderate pace. The trail follows and frequently crosses Bear Canyon Creek, which can be tricky with heavy snow or heavy runoff. Note the emergence of aspen as you gain elevation. Though views are limited, Bear Canyon is not hemmed in quite like others in the area (Gregory Canyon, Fern Canyon and Shadow Canyon), generally affording better views. The trail crosses the creek (right) one last time (4.2 miles : 7,030'), and up a series of steep switchbacks on the canyon's north wall. Travel moderates in the upper canyon, now centrally positioned with terrific views back down the route you just traveled. It levels through a glade to the Bear Peak West Ridge Trail split (4.6 miles : 7,181'). Veer left here for the remaining 1.9 mile, 1280' push to Bear Peak. The West Ridge Trail is initially moderate, tracing a well-defined ridge that leads into the 2012 burn area (5.7 miles : 7,706'). Switchbacks steepen considerably past 6 miles, where you should anticipate many quick, rugged turns. Snow can make this final approach precarious and difficult to read. The trail emerges from timber in a scree field just below the summit (6.35 miles). It curls west (right) to the Shadow Canyon Trail split (6.45 miles : 8,395'), where an unmarked but intuitively followed scramble leads up to Bear Peak (6.48 miles : 8,461'). The pointed, wind-swept summit is little more than a few jagged boulders that may restrict movement, however cautious maneuvering leads to safe viewpoints across the Eastern Plains, Front Range and Continental Divide.",37.3333333333

The Fern Canyon Trail is direct but strenuous, climbing 2100' in just 1.2 miles to the summit. Visitors will enjoy diverse terrain and exceptional views across the plains, foothills and Continental Divide:  From Chautauqua Park, head south on Blue Bell Road to the Mesa Trail (.55 miles : 6,010). Damage from the 2013 floods is pronounced along Bluebell Creek. The Mesa Trail climbs steadily through uniform ponderosa to the Kohler Mesa Trail split (1.15 miles : 6,250'), past which it levels across east-facing contours in open space. The Mesa wraps past Skunk Canyon to a steep, twisting descent that's been nominally re-routed since the floods (1.85 miles : 6,278'). It nadirs across a small stream, then rises back to a large meadow with connections for NCAR (2.0 miles) and Mallory Cave (2.08 miles : 6,215').

Once over it winds steeply up a rutted track past the Bear Canyon Trail split (2.8 miles : 6,280') to the Fern Canyon Trail (2.95 miles : 6,360'). The Fern Canyon Trail climbs several hundred yards before leveling parallel to the Flatirons in a mixed pine forest with good viewing lanes for wildlife. Travel moderates to the Shanahan Ridge Trail (3.28 miles : 6,667'), where the Fern Canyon Trail turns west on an increasingly steep and strenuous path. It rises sharply through large boulders, outcrops and rock chutes to a brief respite with excellent views of Dinosaur Mountain and Green Mountain (3.65 miles : 7,405'). Honor well-marked closures for Peregrine Falcons that nest in this vicinity. Grades steepen considerably on a direct line for the summit, passing through fire scars just before clearing treeline. The trail emerges from timber at the foot of a steep boulder field, up which you'll scramble 50-75 yards to Bear Peak (4.15 miles : 8,461'). The pointed, wind-swept summit is little more than a jagged boulder pile that can limit exploration, however cautious maneuvering leads to sheltered nooks with rangy panoramas across the Eastern Plains, Indian Peaks and Rocky Mountain National Park. Burn scars from the 2012 Flagstaff Fire come in full view from the summit, especially down the west slope of South Boulder Peak.",37.3333333333

Sediments deposited by inland oceans compressed this layer into sandstone, thrust upward 45 million years ago by the same forces that created our modern Rocky Mountains. Water, wind, and mechanical erosion have since shaped these exposed rocks into the angular formations we see today. Trail Map | Photos The Chautauqua Trail leads up and to the backside of Flatiron #1 with terrific views across the Boulder Valley, Indian Peaks and Rocky Mountain National Park: The trail begins on a wide, graded path through open space past connections for the Ski Jump (.2 miles) and Bluebell Mesa (.3 miles) trails to the Bluebell-Baird Trail junction (.6 miles : 6,160'). Bear left, then immediately right at this 3-way fork toward Flatiron #1. The trail splits quickly again for Flatiron #1 (.7 miles : 6,253') - follow signs right and continue on steep switchbacks across an uneven talus field. Lingering snow and ice may conceal the exact path, and certainly warrant a cautious approach. Views of Boulder improve as you climb higher, particularly the downtown area and signature red rooftops of the CU campus. The trail passes consecutive climbing access spurs for Flatironette (.85 miles) and Flatiron #1 (.88 miles) to the base of an 8' rock face. Foot notches aid the pitched scramble, and the flat area just above is a fine place to enjoy views back east. The climb resumes on tightly wound switchbacks to a rocky notch with cross-section views of the Flatiron rock layers. It continues through the notch and moderates high above the steep canyon between Flatiron #1 and #3, the latter brilliantly lit on early summer mornings. The trail curls up a final set of switchbacks to the back of Flatiron #1 and its official end at the Saddle Rock Trail split (1.4 miles : 7,142'). From here a short scramble leads up to an alcove behind Flatiron #1 with panoramas across Boulder's back range and Continental Divide (1.45 miles : 7,185').",37.3333333333

The trail remains open, however, the cave itself is not open to the public. The closure stems from an epidemic of white-nosed syndrome, a fungal disease that has destroyed bat populations across the country.  The U.S. Forest Service closed all caves on National Grassland and Forest properties across several states to limit the potential for spread in the Western region. Because the disease is primarily found in human-accessible recreational caves, people are thought to be the main cause of spreading.   Mallory Cave was first discovered, but not recorded, by loggers cutting down trees on Dinosaur Mountain in the early 1900s. The cave, only a rumor at the time, was 'rediscovered' by University of Colorado Student E.C. Mallory in the summer of 1932. Mallory Cave is of modest size and lacks the stalagmites and stalactites one might expect, however the cave is of special importance to Fringed Myotis and Townsend's Big Eared bats, whose maternity colonies roost here between April and October.  Mallory Cave can be reached from either the Walter Orr Roberts Trail at NCAR, or the Mesa Trail beginning in Chautauqua Park. The former is short and direct, while the latter is longer but arguably more scenic, passing Boulder's iconic Flatirons and more varied terrain en route to the Mallory Cave split.

The Mesa Trail levels across open contours with good views of the eastern plains. It dips and rises past the Skunk Canyon Trail junction to a steep, twisting descent on reinforced mud-stairs (1.85 miles). Once down the trail rises across open slopes with good views of Bear Peak to the Mallory Cave Trail junction (2.05 miles : 6,207'). Travel steepens on a rocky climb up the heavily wooded north flank of Dinosaur Mountain. You'll come to a helpful trail marker in 2.5 miles (6,490'), past which it tightens on switchbacks through dense pine and large rock formations. Pass consecutive spurs for Der Zerkle Climbing access (2.55 miles), squeeze through a slot between two boulders (2.6 miles ) and skip by the Upper Dinosaur Mountain climbing access spur (2.65 miles) to the vertical rock base of Mallory Cave (2.7 miles : 6,810'). Here interpretive signs discuss the life cycles and migratory patterns of Townsend's Big Eared and Fringed Myotis bats, which rely on this cave and surrounding rock crevices for protection of their maternity colonies. The rock face must be scaled to see and enter the cave (currently not open to the public). Confident climbers and scramblers will have little trouble with this knobby 30' wall, but those unfit may opt for additional aid. Snow and ice can present serious challenges for any skill level; exercise patience and good judgment before embarking on the entry climb.",37.3333333333

Exposed granite at the canyon's west end was formed by seeping magma that cooled and solidified quartz, feldspar and biotite into igneous rock. Overlying this granite is 1.6 billion year old quartzite, which began as a thick layer of eroded sand that was buried, compressed into sedimentary rock and pushed closer to the earth's core. Rising heat and pressure transformed this layer into metamorphic rock, a gray quartzite found at Supremacy Rock and Rattlesnake Gulch. 300 million years ago the Ancestral Rocky Mountain uplift, about 30 miles west, bore granite mountains that slowly eroded, depositing thick layers of sand and pebbles downstream. These sediments were compressed into a layer of sandstone known as the Fountain Formation, famously exposed in Boulder's Flatirons and Golden's Red Rocks Amphitheater. Hematite, or iron ore, gives these rocks a distinguished red hue. Most of Eldorado Canyon's highest cliff walls are part of this formation. 280 million years ago sand blew west from eastern deserts, settling as dunes over the Fountain Formation and compressed into sedimentary rock over the next 40 million years. This newest layer, known as the Lyons Formation, is visible at the mouth of Eldorado Canyon. 65 million years ago a second Rocky Mountain uplift forced horizontal layers of the Fountain and Lyons formations upward, exposed today by the erosive force of South Boulder Creek. These tilted layers usher water 8,000' underground, where it's forced back to the surface as an artesian spring. The Fowler Trail - self guided nature walk traces a short section of South Boulder Creek east through the canyon with revealing perspective on the towering cliffs above. Free interpretive brochures at the Visitor Center explain the canyon's complex geology, rich biology and storied human history. The Fowler Trail is ideal for curious minds and families of any age and skill level. The Fowler Trail begins at the Rattlesnake Gulch Trailhead and heads east on level track past the Rattlesnake Gulch Trail split. 12 marked points along the way correlate with an educational brochure. The trail continues east and wraps just south of the canyon mouth to the Eldorado Canyon State Park boundary (.7 miles : 6,110'). Retrace your steps back, or continue on the Fowler Trail 1.3 miles to its eastern terminus at the Eldorado Mountain Trailhead.

This popular 2.6 mile segment accesses South Boulder Creek, prized by fly fishers, runners, equestrians and picnickers seeking an animated backdrop to leisurely strolls along its accommodating banks. The South Boulder Creek Trail is accessible from the South Boulder Creek and Crescent Meadows Trailheads; from each it drops precipitously to the creek, which bisects its midpoint. Visitors not completing the entire Walker Ranch Loop will find little reason to hike the segment in full, but those who do will experience two markedly different environments. The southern, north-facing portion passes through dense lodgepole and fir, its opaquely shaded slopes seeing cooler temperatures and lingering snow well into spring. The northern, south-facing section was taken by fire in 2000, leaving a charred, barren landscape in its wake. Despite compromised aesthetics, fire is crucial to the natural lifecycle and healthy maintenance of a pine forest ecosystem. Periodic fire thins under-stories and deadfall, preventing the long term buildup of fuel that can lead to more permanently devastating events. It also replenishes soil and clears space for the reclamation of diverse native plant species on which local wildlife depend. Ponderosa Pine, protected by a resinous fire-resistant bark, need fire to pry open their cones to release seeds and initiate reproduction. In Walker Ranch, grasses and wildflowers have reemerged on these hillsides and recovery is well under way. The following description begins at the Crescent Meadows Trailhead (southern terminus): The South Boulder Creek Trail drops steeply on winding switchbacks through dense pine forest to South Boulder Creek (1.3 miles : 6,740').

Turn left, then veer right on the service road (2.85 miles) to remain on the Spring Brook North Trail. The Spring Brook North Trail heads north beside walls of rippled Dakota Sandstone, compressed layers of sediment deposited by the ebb and flow of inland oceans that stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Hudson Bay between 600 and 300 million years ago. The Spring Brook North Trail rejoins the Fowler Trail to complete the loop (3.5 miles : 6,075') and leads back to the Eldorado Mountain Trailhead (4.05 miles).",39.7333333333

The Meadow Creek and Bergen Peak trails form a 4.7 mile route to the summit, highlighted by diverse forests and abundant wildlife. While views are somewhat limited, visitors will enjoy good trail conditions and an excellent chance to see deer and elk along the way: Trail Map | Photos The Meadow Creek Trail heads north to the Sleepy S Trail split (.3 miles : 7,868'), and through a sloping ponderosa forest with viewing lanes down into the upper meadows. The Meadow Creek Trail reaches the Bergen Peak Trail at .95 miles (8,022'), where you'll begin appreciably steeper switchbacks to the Denver Mountain Parks Boundary (1.3 miles : 8,167'). Steady climbing leads through dense lodgepole columns (2.0 miles : 8,415') to a more open ridge with partial views of western and southern peaks (2.5 miles : 8,720'). The trail crosses into the Bergen Peak Wildlife Management Area (3.0 miles : 9,007'), where it steepens and straightens through a ponderosa park. Variously steep and moderate intervals lead back into thick lodgepole, joined by aspen and fir as you progress. Look for porcupine and grouse in this montane transition zone. The trail reaches the Too Long Trail split (3.58 miles : 9,207'), which to this point offers a comparable but less crowded route to the summit. They merge and continue as the Bergen Peak Trail on winding switchbacks through mixed conifer and aspen. Note large blocks of quartz scattered about these hillsides. The trail moderates and wraps to an east-facing outcrop just below the summit, where it all but fades amid rock and root. This is a fine stopping point, but it's not the summit. To reach the summit, turn uphill past the radio tower and follow a faint but intuitive path to the Bergen Peak sign (4.7 miles : 9,708'). The rather anonymous summit is in sight of the radio tower and ringed by thick timber, limiting views and room to explore.

Elk Meadow Park spans 1,140 acres below the peak, and a well-maintained trail network that funnels several different starting points onto the Bergen Peak Trail up to the summit. While most visitors begin at the trailhead on Stagecoach Blvd, consider the equidistant Elk Meadow Park Trailhead on Lewis Ridge Road, a route that follows the Too Long Trail to the Bergen Peak Trail. This is a compelling alternative highlighted by travel through the meadows and lighter use. You may extend the hike by returning south on the Meadow View Trail to form a loop around Elk Meadow back to the trailhead. This adds only .5 miles and nominal elevation gain to the hike: From the trailhead on Lewis Ridge Road, veer right off the Sleepy S Trail to pick up the Painters Pause Trail. Painters Pause runs north to the Founders Trail (.45 miles : 7,655'), where you can divert a few steps to see an historical cabin. The Founders Trail edges northwest across the meadow to the Meadow View Trail (1.05 miles : 7,825'), which turns south and steepens in thicker timber on the west side of the meadow to the Too Long Trail (1.5 miles : 8,055'). The Too Long Trail climbs methodically on winding switchbacks with expanding views across Elk Meadow Park and peaks to the east. Variously steep and moderate grades pass through open hillsides and intervals of ponderosa, lodgepole and fir to 3.0 miles (8,895') - an 840' gain in just 1.5 miles from the Too Long split.

75,Elk Meadow Loop,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,3.5,7628,8097,469,2,True,"Elk Meadow Park spans an aggregate of historic homestead parcels that were first established in the late 1850s, and changed hands several times over the decades before acquisition by Jefferson County Open Space in 1975. Elk Meadow Park covers 1140 acres of expansive meadows, ponderosa parks and montane forests at the foot of Bergen Peak. A well-maintained multiuse trail system offers routes of varying distance and difficulty through the meadows, foothills and up to the summit (9,708'). Prior to European settlement the central Colorado foothills were a mosaic of open meadows and pinyon - ponderosa forests that supported large elk herds. The grassland - ponderosa forest ecosystem is naturally maintained by low-intensity fires every 5-15 years that keep tree and shrub densities in check. Mature ponderosa bark can withstand such fires, while their cones need this heat to open and release seeds. Fire also rejuvenates soil and clears space for grazing and seasonal migrations. Homesteading in the late 1800s ushered in decades of fire suppression, producing forests of unnatural densities susceptible to widespread, high-intensity fires from which they cannot always recover. It's thought that only a few dozen trees once naturally occupied an acre of land, whereas today they can exceed thousands. Through careful management, selective cutting and prescribed burns, Elk Meadow Park has successfully restored this ecosystem to a natural state. Elk now roam here year round, joined by deer, badger, bear and mountain lion. The Sleepy S, Painters Pause, Founders, Meadow View and Elk Ridge trails form an easy 3.5 mile loop around the heart of the meadows. Hikers, runners and cyclists will enjoy mild grades, year-round utility and a great chance to see elk in their natural habitat. The following description travels counter-clockwise on the Elk Meadow Loop: From the trailhead on Lewis Ridge Road, veer right off the Sleepy S Trail to pick up the Painters Pause Trail. Painters Pause runs north to the Founders Trail (.45 miles : 7,655'), where you can divert a few steps to see an historical cabin. The Founders Trail edges northwest across the meadow and bands of ponderosa to the Meadow View Trail (1.05 miles : 7,825'). The Meadow Trail turns south and undulates through intervals of mixed pine, aspen and open space between the meadow and lower slopes of Bergen Peak. This is a particularly good stretch to minimize your profile and look for wildlife. You'll reach the Elk Ridge Trail at 2.45 miles (8,058'), and turn back down through the meadows to pick up the Sleepy S Trail (3.0 miles : 7,752').

As with many Boulder-area destinations there are several ways to get there - the Gregory Canyon and Ranger trails offer the most direct route:  The Gregory Canyon Trail rises gently to a stream crossing (.55 miles), then climbs steeply on a twisting, rocky path to milder switchbacks in the upper canyon (1.0 miles : 6,650'). The Gregory Creek corridor supports apple and plum trees that attract bear and other wildlife. It's also covered with poison ivy, so remain on the trail at all times. Travel eases considerably on a SW curl to the Ranger Trail - Long Canyon Trail split (1.3 miles : 6,655'). Merge left onto the Ranger Trail. The Ranger Trail remains flat to the historic Greenman Lodge (1.45 miles), past which it climbs methodically to the E.M. Greenman Trail split (1.75 miles : 6,950'). Here the Ranger Trail steepens on a series of tight switchbacks. Gaps in the forest offer a glimpse of snow-capped peaks to the west, a welcome sight along an otherwise business-like climb. The Ranger Trail climbs to the Green-Bear Trail - Green Mt West Ridge Trail split along a narrow ridge below the summit (2.55 miles : 7,860'). Turn left toward Green Mountain. The final 300 yards weave quickly through faint and rugged terrain to the summit. Tree markings offer guidance on the final approach. Scramble up the rock pile on Green Mountain's summit to reach a peak-finder that identifies peaks across a 100 mile panorama (2.72 miles : 8,144'). Gregory Canyon is named for John Gregory, an ambitious miner who in the 1860s built a road up the canyon to gold mines in the Black Hawk area. Though serviceable for several decades, the road's rudimentary construction and canyon's steep pitch were prohibitive, and eventually Flagstaff Road was completed in 1906 to replace it. The Ranger Trail's origin is often attributed to Martin Parsons, a dedicated local ranger in the early 1900s. Apple trees in lower Gregory Canyon were likely planted by Ernest Greenman, who's credited with planting hundreds of apple trees throughout the Boulder foothill canyons.",38.5166666667

Boulder's extensive trail network connects the two, with numerous ways to reach both in a day.  One route begins in Gregory Canyon and joins the Ranger Trail to scale Green Mountain; it continues on the Green-Bear Trail to the Bear Peak West Ridge Trail and up to Bear Peak. Sometimes referred to as the 'Green and Bear It' for its vertical profile, this challenging route follows steep terrain, quiet forests and high ridges with excellent views en route to the summits. The following description summits both peaks, and omits re-summiting Green Mountain on the return: The Gregory Canyon Trail rises steadily to a stream crossing (.5 miles : 6,162'), then climbs steeply on a twisting, rocky path to milder switchbacks in the upper canyon (1.0 miles : 6,670'). The 2013 floods stripped away much of the corridor's vegetation, revealing portions of stream that were typically veiled. Look for bears foraging apple and plum trees throughout the canyon. The trail gradually levels and curls SW, following a nominally re-routed path beside a newly carved gorge to the historic Greenman Lodge at the Ranger Trail split (1.48 miles : 6,754'). The Ranger Trail moderates through tall, mixed pine to the E.M. Greenman Trail split (1.7 miles : 6,965'), past which it steepens on a winding, business-like climb. The Ranger Trail crests at the Green-Bear Trail - Green Mt West Ridge Trail split along a narrow ridge below the summit (2.55 miles : 7,860'). Turn left toward Green Mountain. The summit access trail scrambles over rock and root to Green Mountain (2.7 miles : 8,144'). The summit is small but topped by a rock-spire and peak-finder that illustrates a 100-mile span. From Green Mountain, head back down to the Green-Bear Trail (2.85 miles) and turn south downhill. Portions of this descent are steep but the majority is moderate and smooth, an ideal track for runners. A few thinly treed meadows along the way provide good habitat and viewing lanes for wildlife. The Green-Bear Trail drops 680' in 1.75 miles down the south flank of Green Mountain to the Bear Canyon Trail - Bear Peak West Ridge Trail split in the saddle between the summits (4.65 miles : 7,181'). Turn up the West Ridge Trail for the 1.9 mile, 1280' push to Bear Peak. The West Ridge Trail is initially moderate, tracing a well-defined ridge with emerging views of Bear Canyon, South Boulder Peak and Walker Ranch. Fire scars are visible from a distance, but you'll abruptly enter the burn area at 5.8 miles (7,706'). Despite a ghostly appearance the area is well on its way to recovery. Though it will be many years before healthy pine return, grasses, flowers and ground cover have already rooted. Switchbacks steepen considerably at the base of Bear Peak's conical summit (6.0 miles : 7,805'). Anticipate quick turns up rugged terrain on this final approach; snow and ice can make this strenuous section precarious and difficult to read. The trail emerges from timber in a scree field that wraps (right) to the Shadow Canyon Trail split (6.48 miles : 8,395'), just below the summit on the west face. Here several intuitive scramble routes lead up to Bear Peak (6.55 miles : 8,461'). The most popular route curls back NE to the Fern Canyon Trail split, then up. No matter how you tackle it these final yards are steep, challenging and exposed. The pointed, wind-swept summit is little more than a jagged boulder pile, however cautious maneuvering leads to safe viewing areas across the plains, foothills, and Rocky Mountains. Keep an eye on weather, as there's still considerable elevation gain and exposure on the return.",38.5166666667
87,Greyrock Trail - Greyrock Meadows Loop Trail,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,7.15,5630,7513,1883,4,True,"Greyrock Mountain (7,513') stands prominently over the north rim of Poudre Canyon, 25 minutes from downtown Fort Collins, Colorado. The Grey Rock Trail and Grey Rock Meadows Trail form a loop around the conical formation, with a short but challenging spur that leads to the summit.  The following description travels counter-clockwise on the loop, with an excursion to the summit: From the Greyrock Mountain Trailhead (5,630'), cross the Cache la Poudre River and head west through dense underbrush and ponderosa pine. Bear right at the Grey Rock Meadows Trail - Greyrock Trail split to begin the loop (.65 miles : 5,920'). The Greyrock Trail bends due north and steepens through a tight canyon, gaining nearly 1,000' in just a mile. Deadfall and debris pushed down the canyon by flash floods line the way. The trail eases on the canyon rim with panoramic views of Poudre Canyon, Rocky Mountain National Park, and the Comanche Peak Wilderness Area (1.7 miles : 6,837'). It continues .4 miles north to a revealing look at Greyrock Mountain from the Greyrock Meadows - Summit Trail junction (2.1 miles : 6,973'). The Summit Trail meanders through a striking meadow before taking an aggressive route to the summit. This stretch can be difficult to both hike and follow, with uneven footing and some minor scrambling required to reach the top. Rock cairns and hiker signs offer guidance as the trail rounds the southeast flank of Greyrock Mountain on the final approach. Greyrock Mountain (2.65 miles : 7,513') - known as The Rock to locals - is quite unique. A small lake rests between two points on the summit itself, forming an oasis of ecological diversity in an area one might expect to be barren. Retrace your steps down the Greyrock Summit Trail to the Greyrock Meadows Trail split (3.3 miles : 6,973'). Keep straight on the Greyrock Meadows Trail to continue the loop. The Greyrock Meadows Trail drops on a southwest heading through an area scarred by the Picnic Rock Fire in April 2004. It descends 241' from the Summit Trail split into the stunning open space of Greyrock Meadows (3.65 miles : 6,732'). The trail heads south through Greyrock Meadows with excellent views to the west, and back north of Greyrock Mountain. Look for signs of deer, coyote, fox, skunk, bear, and mountain lion in this richly appointed space. The trail leaves the meadows and switchbacks east on a steady climb through a mixed pine, fir, and spruce forest (4.5 miles : 6,814'). Views of Greyrock Mountain are quite good on this easterly tack. After a mile of steady climbing, the Greyrock Meadows Trail crests and opens up to the fully exposed backside of the loop (5.5 miles : 7,088'). Here the trail begins its final descent, dropping over 1000' in just one mile. The descent provides excellent views to the west of Hewlett Gulch, Poudre Canyon, and surrounding high peaks. The trail returns to the Greyrock Trail - Greyrock Meadows Trail split (6.5 miles : 5,920), where you'll veer onto the Greyrock Trail for .65 miles back to the trailhead (7.15 miles : 5,630').",90.7333333333
88,Bitterbrush Trail to Nelson Loop,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,9.4,5521,6703,1182,3,False,"Hall Ranch is compelling for its colorful mesas, spacious meadows and rich wildlife. The Bitterbrush Trail and Nelson Loop Trail form a 9.4 mile lollipop loop through rolling hills and elevated meadows in the heart of Hall Ranch. Trails at Hall Ranch can be muddy, especially after heavy rain and during the spring thaw. Trail conditions are posted at the trailhead. BIkers are advised to stay off trails when muddy to expedite recovery and reduce rutting:  The Bitterbrush Trail rolls gently through open grassland for .7 miles, then climbs steeply up rugged, tightly-wound switchbacks. Hikers and runners should make room for cyclists on these quick turns. The trail levels on a high ridge overlooking an expansive meadow (2.0 miles : 6,151'). This area supports a large prairie dog village, a good place to see coyote, badger, rattlesnakes and raptors. The Bitterbrush drops sharply to the Antelope Trail split (2.2 miles: 6,089'), and moderates on a rolling course for 1.35 miles to the Nelson Loop Trail junction (3.55 miles: 6,407'). This attractive 2.3 mile loop moves easily through intervals of high open space, thick pine forest and rocky outcrops. Deer are ubiquitous, while rabbit, coyote and fox are also fairly common. The Nelson Loop gains only 360' in total elevation; travel clockwise for a quicker route to its apex, or counter-clockwise on a more leisurely grade. Both directions offer panoramas across the upper meadows toward Mt Meeker and Longs Peak. Approximately half-way around, the Nelson Loop connects with the Nighthawk Trail at its highest point (6,703'). The Nighthawk Trail offers a compelling, bike-free alternative route back to the parking lot. About Hall Ranch This part of Colorado once marked the western shoreline of a massive inland sea that stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Hudson Bay. The inland sea surged and retreated periodically, depositing and compressing sedimentary layers many times over the millennia. Tectonic forces related to the Rocky Mountain uplift rippled east, forcing rock layers to bulge along the plains and exposing them to various forms of erosion. 260 million years ago windblown particles from coastal dunes added to this complex sedimentary mix, creating a hard quartz sandstone called the Lyons Formation. The Lyons Formation has a distinct salmon-red hue for which the iconic mesas of Hall Ranch are known. Hall Ranch ranges from 5,440' - 6,820' and supports a variety of distinct ecosystems: grasslands, shrublands, ponderosa-pinyon woodlands, Douglass fir forests, riparian corridors and canyons. Bluestem, New Mexico feathergrass, and western wheatgrass fill meadows, while durable shrubs such as prickly pear cactus, wax current, yucca, and bitterbrush occupy drier, rockier soil beds. Ponderosa, pinyon, and juniper dot the hillsides, naturally spaced apart to maintain a healthy fire cycle. Fir and lodgepole can be found in denser concentrations at higher elevations on the higher, west side of Hall Ranch. These varied ecosystems overlap in a relatively small space, attracting a wide range of wildlife that includes rattlesnakes, prairie dog, skunk, badger, fox, coyote, turkey, deer, elk, bear, and mountain lion. Bighorn sheep are known to follow winter migration routes through the high, rugged cliffs in the northwest corner of Hall Ranch. Even a short hike through Hall Ranch will expose you to many of these ecotones and inhabitants. Hall Ranch was first homesteaded by Richard Clark in 1890, and since more than 20 families have lived in the area prospecting, farming, or quarrying sandstone. The Nelson family purchased this land in 1922, and later sold to Hallyn and June Hall in the 1940s. The Nelson Loop Trail circles historic Nelson Ranch in the Antelope Park area, whose grain silo and aging homestead still remain. Several spurs leads off the main trail to the site.",61.7666666667
89,Button Rock Trail,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,4.0,6625,6703,78,2,False,"The Button Rock Trail spans a broad valley connecting the Button Rock Preserve with Hall Ranch in Lyons, Colorado. No trailhead provides access: you must either hike Button Rock Preserve's Sleepy Lion Loop Trail (from the west), or Hall Ranch's Nighthawk Trail or Bitterbrush-Nelson Loop Trails (from the east) to reach it. The former is a shorter but rather mundane route, while the latter options are longer but exceptionally attractive. Complete descriptions for each are provided in the related trail links above. To hike these routes in full you'll travel 8.7 and 13.4 miles roundtrip, respectively. No matter how you arrive, the Button Rock Trail's open space and terrific views are worth the visit. The undisturbed corridor through which it passes is home to deer, elk, fox, coyote, turkey, bear, mountain lion, and raptors. Closed to horse and bike travel it sees light use, even during peak season. Early arrivals stand a good chance of seeing the area's abundant wildlife in motion, and having this tranquil area to themselves. From either access point, the Button Rock Trail drops into the open valley and skirts its forested southern wall. Hikers should be cognizant of a nearby service road that - for approximately .8 miles - merges with and becomes the trail. Signposts mark these convergence points clearly (.35 miles from the western terminus : .85 miles from the eastern terminus). The trail nadirs at 6,485' on a hairpin turn in the service road (.9 miles from the top of Hall Ranch : 1.1 miles from the Sleepy Lion Trail connection). Travel east of this point passes through open space in the central valley, offering the trail's best views across it and of the Continental Divide. Mt Meeker (13,911'), Longs Peak (14,259') and the Twin Sisters (11,428' and 11,413') are easy to identify. A handful of rocky outcrops on the valley-fringe are ideal places to minimize your profile, look for wildlife and enjoy the great expanse in front of you. Travel west of the valley-low weaves through thicker forest, though frequently with good looks to the north and east. Easy maneuvering from the Sleepy Lion Trail junction yields terrific views across Ralph Price Reservoir.",71.2833333333
90,Nighthawk Trail,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,9.4,5521,6703,1182,3,False,"Hall Ranch encompasses 3,205 acres of colorful mesas, rolling meadows, pinyon-juniper woodlands, and diverse wildlife. Though only 5 designated trails pass through Hall Ranch, their length and diversity provide numerous routing options and travel experiences.  The Nighthawk Trail offers a bike-free route with connections to the Nelson Loop and Button Rock Trail. Runners may also prefer the Nighthawk's consistent terrain and steady pace: The Nighthawk Trail rolls gently through open grassland for .85 miles, crests and drops into a shallow gully (1.1 miles : 5,555'). Here it begins a 3.6 mile, 1148' climb on winding, moderately steep (but well-kept) switchbacks. The trail bends NW and rises quickly through open rolling hills and over deep canyons. Spring travelers will enjoy wavy green grasses, flowers and cacti blooms. Deer are very common along this stretch. The trail occasionally abuts service roads, but these are not for public use and should not be taken. At 3.65 miles the trail does merge momentarily with a service road, but quickly departs (left) on a clearly marked path into a shallow gully that holds a water tank for horses. The trail climbs above the tank and threads dense pine on the edge of a large, sloping meadow. It's briefly obscured once more on a hairpin turn around the remains of an old stone wall (4.1 miles : 6,702'), but easy to reclaim once around it. The trail crests and moderates (4.4 miles) with excellent views of Mt Meeker, Longs Peak, and the Twin Sisters. A few steps off-trail leads to wider views of the Continental Divide, and down a wide valley ideal for seeing wildlife. The final segment weaves through sparse forest and rocky outcrops into a vast, lofty meadow at the Button Rock Trail split (4.5 miles : 6,703'), and its terminus at the Nelson Loop Trail (4.7 miles : 6,703'). Those seeking a longer hike may add the 2.3 mile Nelson Loop. The Nelson Loop Trail circles Nelson Ranch, whose grain silo and aging homestead are the remains of a once thriving cattle operation. The trail gains only 360' on smooth, mild terrain with terrific views along the way.",61.7666666667

Its 5020 acres support wildlife communities from each, including deer, elk, turkey, coyote, fox, mountain lion and bear.  Elk were extirpated from Boulder County at the turn of the 20th century, but reintroduced at Heil Valley Ranch between 1913 and 1917. Today this protected area remains one of the only places in the Front Range where elk can complete their natural migration from the Rocky Mountains to Eastern Plains with minimal interruption. Heil Ranch's Wapiti and Ponderosa Loop Trails form a 7.7 mile lollipop loop through sloping meadows and healthy ponderosa forests. Mild grades and new improvements make these multi-use trails accessible to hikers, runners, bikers and equestrians year-round: The Wapiti Trail rises from the parking area on a service road into the upper valley. Scars from the 2003 Left Hand Canyon Fire - which came within 1/4 mile of the caretakers cabin - are soon evident. Despite some aesthetic loss recovery is well under way, as ponderosa pine are darkened but largely unaffected, and grasses and wildflowers were quick to reclaim open spaces. The road passes two connections for the Lichen Loop before turning west with a good look down Heil Valley toward the Flatirons (.55 miles : 6,080'). This area supported a prairie dog village wiped out in 2008 by disease; though unfortunate, periodic collapses are part of the prairie dog life cycle, and this village will likely repopulate in years to come. The trail gradually bends north and climbs steadily through uniform timber up the valley's west side to the first of several service road crossings in 1.35 miles (these roads are closed to public use). It resumes a winding course to the Ponderosa Loop Trail junction (2.55 miles : 6,705'). The following description runs clockwise (left): The trail levels in a culled forest atop a sloping plateau. It crests at 3.6 miles (6,792') and drops to an overlook on the plateau's rim at the first of two Wild Turkey Trail connections (4.05 miles : 6,605'). Views include St Vrain Canyon, Hall Ranch, Mt Meeker (13,911') and the Twin Sisters (11,428' - 11,413'). The Ponderosa Trail bends away from the overlook and drops on a rocky path, turning sharply back south to begin the second half of the loop. The trail passes the second Wild Turkey Trail junction (5.05 miles : 6,655') and follows an undulating, nondescript path to complete the loop (5.15 miles : 6,705').

This 3.0 mile offshoot also connects with the Picture Rock Trail, another recent addition that leads 5.2 miles to the north boundary of Heil Ranch.  Note the Wild Turkey Trail is not a loop by itself (see map), but connects with the Ponderosa Loop at two different points. You must first travel 2.55 miles on the Wapiti Trail to reach the Ponderosa Loop. The following describes counter-clockwise travel on the Ponderosa Loop to the Wild Turkey Trail. See Worth Noting below for various route and distance totals trough Heil Valley Ranch: The Wapiti Trail rises from the parking area on a service road into the upper valley.

The trail resumes a winding course to the Ponderosa Loop Trail junction (2.55 miles : 6,705'), where you'll turn right to reach the Wild Turkey Trail (2.7 miles : 6,655'). The Wild Turkey Trail bends sharply south before curling back north through a more naturally spaced forest with good viewing lanes for wildlife. It moves north down the eastern slopes of Heil Ranch to the Picture Rock Trail junction (3.9 miles : 6,393'), past which it rises back through pockets of open savannah. At 5.2 miles the Wild Turkey Trail levels on a high plateau and rejoins the Ponderosa Loop Trail at a scenic overlook (5.75 miles : 6,605'). A few steps off trail lead to good views of St Vrain Canyon, the Lyons Sandstone of Hall Ranch, Mt Meeker (13,911'), and Twin Sisters (11,428' - 11,413'). Note pockets of fir at these higher elevations. Here you may travel in either direction on the Ponderosa Loop, but turn left for what most consider to be the Wild Turkey Loop route. The east leg of the Ponderosa loop Trail undulates south on a rocky path back to the first connection with the Wild Turkey Trail (6.75 miles : 6,655'). Continue straight to the Ponderosa Loop Trail - Wapiti Trail junction (6.9 miles : 6,705'). Retrace your steps on the Wapiti Trail back to the parking lot (9.5 miles : 5,945'). Heil Ranch and Fire Fire is crucial to a healthy ponderosa-grassland ecosystems. Naturally occurring, low intensity fires clear space for mature trees, keep densities in check and rejuvenate soils. Prior to European settlement, the Boulder foothills were a mosaic of open savannah grasslands and well-spaced pinyon and ponderosa. Fire suppression since the 1880s has created unsustainable forest densities that can result in destructive, high intensity fires. It's thought that only a few dozen trees once occupied an acre of land in the Heil Ranch area, whereas today they can exceed thousands. Major efforts beginning in 2008 to cull the forest are meant to mitigate fire impact while restoring the natural balance between grasslands and timber. These ongoing efforts have already yielded positive results, evidenced by wildlife population measurements and the relative containment of subsequent burns in the vicinity.",54.7

Horsetooth Mountain Open Space Park supports 29 miles of multipurpose trails through native grasslands, ponderosa woodlands and montane forests.  Horsetooth Rock (7,256') caps Horsetooth Mountain, the park's tallest and most recognizable feature. According to Native American legend, Horsetooth Rock is the remains of the heart of an evil giant, slain and cut in two by Chief Maununmoku. European settlers believed the rock bore a greater resemblance to a horse tooth, hence the modern name. Numerous routes lead to the summit; the most direct route begins at the Horsetooth Mountain Open Space Trailhead and follows the Horsetooth Rock Trail: The Horsetooth Rock Trail rises through open grasslands dotted with yucca, cacti, and cattail to the Horsetooth Falls Trail connection (.32 miles : 5,923').

Remain vigilant to a set of rock-notch steps just below the Audra Culver Trail split (2.25 miles : 6,982'). The trail keeps a north-northwest heading past an informational sign before curling steeply to a gap on the north side of the Horsetooth. Here you'll begin a short but rugged scramble (back south) to the top of Horsetooth Rock and Horsetooth Mountain summit (2.5 miles : 7,256'). The summit is long and thin with unabated panoramas across the eastern plains, lower foothills, reservoir, and Rocky Mountains. Notable from these heights are hogbacks, or homoclinal ridges, that run uniformly north-south between the plains and foothills. These uplifted and tilted formations are typically comprised of two compressed sedimentary layers that eroded at different rates. As the softer layer erodes, its slopes steepen and the harder layer emerges along it edges. These rounded formations with a jagged rock outline resemble the knobby spine of a hog.",79.6666666667
98,Lion Gulch Trail to Homestead Meadows,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,6.1,7370,8447,1077,3,True,"The Homestead Act of 1862 encouraged western expansion by opening America's land to agricultural settlement. To qualify, a person had to be a US citizen (or express the intent to become one), older than 21 (or head of a household) and possess less than 160 acres of their own land.  To acquire the property title one had to build a house within 5 years, occupy the land for at least 6 months of the year, make income related to the property and cultivate a portion of the land. After 6 months one could buy the land for $1.25 an acre, or $15 outright after 5 years. Homesteaders could acquire up to 320 acres of land under the Act, a program that ended in 1976. Homestead Meadows, listed on the National Registry of Historic Places, contains the remains of over a dozen cabins from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It's easy to see why this area attracted homesteaders, with miles of rolling meadows well-suited for ranching, hunting and building. Visitors will enjoy a moderate hike on the Lion Gulch Trail to an up-close look at these well-preserved historic sites: The trail drops from the parking lot into a gulch, over a creek and rises steadily up the far side. It crosses back over (.35 miles) and merges with the equestrian trail (.45 miles : 7,435'), gradually bending northwest (.6 miles) along the upper-gulch. The trail crosses a third bridge (1.0 miles : 7,538') and intensifies on a twisting, undulating course in a busy forest. Pinyon, lodgepole and ponderosa give way to aspen, fir and spruce on the rapid climb. Grades moderate beside a small creek (1.9 miles : 8,137') as the forest opens on level double track (2.5 miles : 8,345') to the Lion's Paw Trail - Pierson Park split (2.95 miles : 8,424'). Continue straight to the welcome sign for Homestead Meadows (3.05 miles : 8,447') and access to the Walker, Griffith, Irvin and Brown homestead sites (an additional .25, .5, 1.5 and 2.0 miles, respectively). The main trail continues through an aspen-ringed meadow and skirts the Walker Homestead, with various social trails leading to its scattered remains. It re-enters a sparse forest and rises modestly to the next three sites. Be mindful of private property boundaries and stay on designated trails as you move deeper into the historic district. Those not pressing on may consider minimizing their profile around the meadows' edge and looking for wildlife such as deer, elk, turkey and fox.",75.35
99,Lion's Paw Trail to Pierson Park,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,14.2,7370,9085,1715,4,True,"The Homestead Act of 1862 encouraged western expansion by opening America's land to agricultural settlement. To qualify, a person had to be a United States citizen (or express the intent to become one), older than 21 years or head of a household and possess less than 160 acres of their own land. To acquire the property title, one had to build a house within 5 years, occupy the land for at least 6 months of the year, make income related to the property and cultivate a portion of the land. After 6 months one could buy the land for $1.25 an acre, or $15 outright after 5 years. Homesteaders could acquire up to 320 acres of land under the Act, a program that ended in 1976. Homestead Meadows, listed on the National Registry of Historic Places, contains the remains of over a dozen cabins from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Lion's Paw Trail leads through diverse montane forests and several large meadows to the Engert, Laycook, Boren and Hill homesteads. It continues deeper into the national forest to its terminus at Pierson Park, a large meadow complex ringed with campsites: The Lion Gulch Trail drops from the parking lot into a gulch, over a creek and rises steadily up the far side. It crosses back and merges with the equestrian trail (.45 miles : 7,435'), bending northwest (.6 miles) along the creek into the upper-gulch. The trail crosses a third bridge (1.0 miles : 7,538') and intensifies on a twisting, undulating course. Pinyon, lodgepole and ponderosa join aspen, fir and spruce as you climb. The trail emerges from dense timber and eases up a slender glade to the Lion's Paw Trail - Pierson Park split (2.95 miles : 8,324'). Bear left on the Lion's Paw Trail across the meadow on what soon widens to an old wagon road leading to the first of four homesteads. The trail rounds a hill and emerges on the edge of a vast, fire-scarred and blown-down area at a spur for Engert Homestead (3.15 miles : 8,466'). Fire is natural and essential to this ecosystem, and aesthetics have been quickly restored by grasses, wildflowers and waves of young aspen. The trail eases past the second Engert Homestead spur (3.6 miles : 8,590') and pitches down to the Laycook Homestead spur on the edge of a vast meadow. The Laycook Homestead is one of the newest and therefore most intact of all, with an adjacent meadow ideal for seeing wildlife. The trail rolls to the Hill Homestead spur (4.2 miles : 8,327') and rises gently to the Boren Homestead, located just off-trail and easy to investigate (4.7 miles : 8,370'). Grades level past Boren, skirting the area's largest meadow where fire scars yield to healthy intervals of ponderosa parks, streams and young aspen - arguably the Lion Paw's most pleasant section (5.0 - 5.5 miles). The path narrows on a strenuous climb to the trail's highest point (6.1 miles : 9,147'). Here it drops sharply through an unremarkable forest to its terminus at Pierson Park (7.1 miles : 9,085'). Note that Pierson Park is curiously unmarked, as is the forest service road on its far side.",75.35

Runners, cyclists and families will enjoy mild grades, good trail conditions and rangy views across Eldorado Canyon, the Flatirons and Boulder foothills.  The Marshall Mesa Loop touches the Southern Grasslands Habitat Conservation Area, which protects the largest remaining parcel of intact grassland habitat in the Boulder area. This tallgrass ecosystem once stretched eastward from the Rockies to Indiana, north to Canada and south through Texas. Today only 2% of its original composition remains, much of it re-purposed by man or overtaken by mixed grass prairie. Mule deer, coyote and prairie dogs are common in these prairies, which also support badger, ferret, burrowing owl and rattlesnakes. A restored section of Coal Creek cuts across the HCA, where bald eagles and ground-nesting birds return each year to breed. The following description begins at the Marshall Mesa Trailhead and travels clockwise on the loop: Head south from the parking lot to the Marshall Valley Trail and bear left (east). The trail rises gently up the open north flank of Marshall Mesa past a large prairie dog village to the Community Ditch - Marshall Mesa Trail split (.9 miles : 5,575'). Bear left on the Community Ditch Trail, which steepens to the Cowdrey Draw Trail junction (1.2 miles : 5,680'). The Community Ditch Trail turns sharply back west and levels on a wide, groomed path atop the mesa with long views across the western plains, mouth of Eldorado Canyon, foothills and Flatirons. It passes connections for Marshall Reservoir (1.4 miles : 5,725'), the second Marshall Mesa Trail access point (2.2 miles : 5,730') and Greenbelt Plateau Trail (2.3 miles : 5,732') on this mild stretch.

Portions of this trail system touch the Southern Grasslands Habitat Conservation Area and Cowdrey Draw Natural Area, which protect the largest remaining parcel of intact grassland habitat in Boulder. Tall grass prairies once stretched east from the Rockies to Indiana, north to Canada and south through Texas. Today only 2% of its original composition remains, much of it re-purposed by man or overtaken by mixed grass prairie, a blend of bluestem, switch grass, Indian grass, grama and buffalo grass. Visitors will enjoy mild grades, abundant wildflowers and sweeping views across the eastern plains, Boulder foothills and back range summits: Head south from the parking lot and bear left on the Marshall Valley Trail. The trail rises up the open north flank of Marshall Mesa, highlighted by exposed rock of the Laramie Formation. 100 million years ago an inland sea covered Colorado's Front Range, leaving behind deep layers of sediment upon its retreat. These sediments were compressed into rock and thrust upward 70 million years ago by the modern Rocky Mountain uplift, exposing the light sandstone we see here today. The trail moves easily through open space and prairie dog villages to the Community Ditch - Marshall Mesa Trail (.9 miles : 5,575'). Bear left on the Community Ditch Trail, which steepens to the Cowdrey Draw Trail (1.2 miles : 5,680'). The Cowdrey Draw Trail enters the Cowdrey Draw Natural Area and continues east, edging up and down Marshall Mesa to its terminus on 66th street (2.0 miles : 5,623').

102,Mt Sanitas Loop Trail,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,3.1,5520,6843,1323,4,True,"Tectonic forces along northern Colorado's front range created ripples that forced rock layers to bulge and compress, creating anticlines - or convex folds on the earth's surface. As the bulging anticlines' softer sediments eroded, only hard ridges - known as Hogbacks - remained from previously rounded hilltops between the eastern plains and Rocky Mountain uplift. Mt Sanitas is one such formation that stands above all others in central Boulder, Colorado.  The Mt Sanitas West Ridge Trail and Sanitas Valley Trail form a short but challenging loop to its rugged summit, and along its east face. The following description begins on Mapleton Road and travels clockwise from the West Ridge to Sanitas Valley Trail: Cross the bridge and turn left twice to pick up the Mt Sanitas West Ridge Trail. The trail climbs steeply and ruggedly for .85 miles before moderating on a thin ridge with good southwest views across Sunshine Canyon and Chautauqua Park. It bends north on the final approach to the Mt Sanitas summit (1.2 miles : 6,843'). Space is limited, but easy to maneuver about for panoramas of the foothills, plains and Continental Divide. The trail continues north and drops abruptly down rugged, tightly-wound switchbacks. You'll negotiate several sparingly marked switchbacks through car-sized boulders (1.4 miles) before turning sharply south (1.65 miles). The trail edges back east through open space to the Sanitas Valley Trail (1.95 miles : 6,080'). This wide fire road glides gently south between Dakota Ridge and the east face of Sanitas.The Sanitas Valley Trail completes the loop and leads back to all parking areas on Mapleton Road.

Located just 2 miles north of Nederland, Colorado, scenic Mud Lake is surrounded by 233 acres of pristine wilderness that provide year-round recreation for hikers, mountain bikers and horseback riders.  The double loop trail described here is made possible by simply combining the Tungsten Loop Trail with the Kinneckinneck Loop Trail.  From the NW corner of the Mud Lake Parking lot (next to the restrooms), the trail sets out flat through dense coniferous forest typical of the Nederland area. After .1 miles you'll encounter the first trail split. Turn left towards the Tungsten Loop.  50' away, the Tungsten Loop Trail begins and Mud Lake is soon visible. The trail skirts the east shore of Mud Lake and, despite easy access to the lake itself, fishing, swimming or boating are NOT allowed. These regulations are strictly enforced.At .6 miles the trail reaches the Tungsten Loop - Kinneckinneck Loop split (8,484').  Bear left towards the Kinneckinneck Loop Trail - in about 100', the Kinneckinneck Loop Trail begins. The loop rises gently amid healthy stands of Aspen and Ponderosa Pine.  At 1.3 miles, the Kinneckinneck Loop crests at 8,594' and yields the best (and only) views of the entire trail. Large peaks and glaciers are visible to the north and west as you begin downward to complete the Kinneckinneck Loop.  At 1.7 miles you will complete the Kinneckinneck loop and take the clearly marked 100' connector trail back to the Tungsten Loop. Head left to complete the last section of the Tungsten Loop.

104,Mallory Cave (Boulder - NCAR Mesa Trailhead),boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,2.8,6080,7020,940,3,True,"Note: Mallory Cave is closed until further notice. The trail remains open, however, the cave itself is not open to the public. The closure stems from an epidemic of white-nosed syndrome, a fungal disease that has destroyed bat populations across the country.  The U.S. Forest Service closed all caves on National Grassland and Forest properties across several states in an attempt to limit the potential for spread in the Western region. Because the disease is primarily found in human-accessible recreational caves, people are thought to be the main cause of spreading.  The Mallory Cave Trail in Boulder's front range is a short but steep hike to a large cave first discovered, but not recorded, by loggers cutting down trees on Dinosaur Mountain. The cave was then re-discovered in the summer of 1932 by a young University of Colorado Student named E.C. Mallory.  Begin by heading out on the Walter Orr Roberts Trail, an interpretative trail just west of the NCAR parking lot. Head west on this trail for about .6 miles before hitting the Mesa Trail. Turn hard left on to the Mesa Trail and then quickly head up the clearly marked trail to Mallory Cave.  Upon turning onto the trail to Mallory Cave, the hike will get quite steep. The narrow trail leads you up Dinosaur Mountain through towering sandstone formations with outstanding views of Boulder and the plains back to the east.  As you near the end of the hike, keep an eye out for a red rock staircase which leads straight up to the final staging area before climbing to the cave itself. There will be signs directing you to the cave so be sure to pay attention.  The final 50-75 feet of the climb are difficult. While not a technical climb, the route is steep, rocky and slick. Be very careful in wet or cold weather, as the final ascent to the cave can be very dangerous.  After the final ascent to the cave, enjoy spectacular views of NCAR, Boulder and the eastern plains. While the cave itself may appear a bit ""used"", people continue to marvel at its history as one of Boulder's oldest recorded front range hikes.",38.9833333333
105,Hogback Lollipop Loop,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,2.95,5565,5565,828,3,False,"This short trail climbs and circles the east face of a Hogback, a sharply rounded ridge with steep sloping sides where the eastern plains meet Colorado's Front Range. Visitors will enjoy good wildlife viewing opportunities and rangy views across the Flatirons and eastern plains. The trailhead is located on the east side of Highway 36; from the parking area walk through the underpass to access the Foothills Trail. En route you'll pass a lively Prairie Dog town, where interpretive signs explain the animals' sophisticated communication techniques and reliance of other species on the community for food and shelter. The Foothills Trail rises steadily to the Foothills Trail - Hogback Loop Trail junction (.6 miles : 5,760'). Here the Foothills Trail bends south (left) towards Wonderland Lake, and the right fork trail continues north for several miles along the foothills. The Hogback Loop's left fork takes a steep, direct approach to the loop's highest point, while the right fork runs a longer, more gradual course. With better views and lighting in mind, the following describes clockwise travel on the Hogback Loop Trail: From the split, steep grades continue up rudimentary stairs (.9 miles) that spill into a saddle between two hogbacks (1.15 miles : 6,192'). Rocky outcrops and pine trees dot the saddle, a pretty space with good perspective on this uniquely textured landscape. After a brief reprieve a short, final push leads to the top of a boulder-strewn hogback (1.35 miles : 6,393). Exercise caution when scrambling about, as rattlesnakes are common to the area. The trail crests atop the hogback and drops quickly on its northern ridge to milder grades that run perpendicular across a yawning eastern slope. You'll enjoy sensational views of the eastern plains, Boulder Reservoir and Chautauqua Park area on this diverting stretch. Travel eases upon completing the loop (2.35 miles), and continues downhill .6 miles back to the trailhead.",43.7
106,North Table - Tilting Mesa - Mesa Top Loop,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,3.2,6030,6030,478,2,True,"North Table Mountain Park is located on the east side of Highway 93 in Golden, Colorado. The Park encompasses 2,000 acres of a large mesa complex that rises 500' from the open plains to a sprawling mixed grass prairie on top. The mesa's core was formed by lava flows that emanated from the Ralston Dike two miles away. Sedimentary deposits that once covered this hardened lava have eroded, resulting in the steep-sided formation we see today. Table Mountain's grasslands support a variety of wildlife including deer, coyote, rabbit, prairie dog, and rattlesnake, while golden eagles, hawks, and falcons nest in vertical cliffs along the mesa's rim. Spring-fed ponds draw waterfowl, and serve as headwaters for riparian corridors that underpin the mountain's ecosystem. A network of multi-use trails circle Table Mountain and connect through its elevated grasslands. The North Table Trail, Tilting Mesa Trail, and Mesa Top Trail form a short loop from base to top, exposing visitors to the area's distinct ecological and geological features. The following description begins on the south side of the parking lot and travels counter-clockwise on the North Table Loop Trail: The North Table Loop Trail climbs steeply on wide rough pour to the mesa top and Tilting Mesa Trail split (.6 miles : 6,478'). Examine folds in the upper cliff walls and look for raptors before veering left on the Tilting Mesa Trail, which ventures east along the mesa top. The Tilting Mesa levels through rolling short grass prairie dotted with cacti, yucca, cattail, yarrow, and a variety of wildflowers. It wraps north around a small pond (1.1 miles : 6,445'), one of several on Table Mountain that attract waterfowl and song birds. Bypass a spur for the Rim Rock Trail (1.55 miles) before seamlessly merging onto the Mesa Top Trail (1.7 miles : 6,485'). The Mesa Top Trail skirts the edge of a much larger pond and edges toward another near a second Rim Rock Trail access spur (1.7 miles : 6,485'). Here it crests and drops back a second connection with the North Table Loop Trail (2.3 miles : 6,085').

Mule deer, coyote, rabbit, prairie dogs and rattlesnakes inhabit the grasslands, while eagles, hawks and falcons nest in vertical cliffs along the mesa rim. Spring-fed ponds draw waterfowl, and form luxuriant riparian corridors that slice down the mountain into the plains. A network of multi-use trails circle Table Mountain and criss-cross the mesa top. The North Table Trail, Mesa Top Trail, and Tilting Mesa Trail form a diverse loop around, up and back down the mountain. The following description travels clockwise on the North Table Loop: The North Table Trail rolls through open grasslands at the mountain's base to the Mesa Spur Trail (1.85 miles : 5,967'). You'll pass multiple marked trail splits en route, and remain on the North Table Trail in each instance. Look for wildlife along riparian corridors that flow from the mesa top into this open space. The trail bends sharply northeast from the Mesa Spur on a sloping hillside dotted with large boulders evidencing the area's volcanic origin. The trail undulates on single track to the Mesa Top Trail split (3.2 miles : 6,060'); bear right for a short, steep climb to the mesa top. Examine the mesa's hardened capstone, and look for raptors along these inaccessible cliffs. The Mesa Top Trail abruptly levels in open space and curls west through the heart of the mesa top (3.65 miles : 6,365').

The grasslands span 193,060 acres of short grass prairie in the South Platte River Basin.  The Pawnee National Grasslands support a wide range of wildlife, and are a renowned birding destination. Lark bunting, mountain plover, burrowing owl, and numerous raptor species are seen throughout the year. Pronghorn, mule deer, coyote, swift fox, rattlesnakes and prairie dogs are primary residents of the Pawnee Grasslands. At first glance the grasslands appear monotonously flat, but closer inspection reveals a complex and visually stunning landscape. Soft surface layers on the high plains from the Brule Formation have eroded faster than areas capped by a harder sandstone conglomerate called the Arikaree Formation, resulting in intricately carved buttes, gullies, mesas, and escarpments throughout the grasslands. The Pawnee Buttes are among the grasslands' most prominent topographic features, rising nearly 300' from the high plains floor. A short trail leads down a major escarpment into a sea of open space, and to the base of each butte. Visitors will enjoy up close inspection of these geologic oddities, magnificent vistas, and excellent wildlife viewing opportunities along the way: The Pawnee Buttes Trail drops quickly down the east face of the Overlook escarpment to the prairie floor, negotiating a few minor washes on the way. It bends northeast into open space framed by Lips Bluff to the south. The trail reaches West Pawnee Butte (1.5 miles : 5,222'), and crosses private property lines soon after (see rules and regulations below). The trail remains level to East Pawnee Butte (2.05 miles : 5,225'), a larger butte complex with rugged gullies emanating from its southern base. Enjoy buttes from a distance, and never attempt to climb them. The buttes and surrounding mesas are comprised of loosely bound sediments that crumble easily, and cannot reliably support weight and pressure.",131.566666667
109,Eagle Wind Trail,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,3.95,5530,5530,336,2,True,"140 million years ago the Rabbit Mountain area marked the western shore of an inland sea that stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Hudson Bay. It was tropical lowland covered by rivers, swamps and lagoons. This sea retreated approximately 65M years ago when tectonic forces pulled the earth's crust, resulting in a western uplift that formed the Rockies.  The uplift's ripples caused rocks to compress and bulge at its base, creating anticlines - or convex folds on the earth's surface. As the bulging anticline's softer sediments eroded, only hard ridges - known as Hogbacks - remained from the previously rounded hilltops. Rabbit Mountain's position three miles east of similar anticline formations along the Front Range is unique. The complex movements of two faults in the area pushed these eroding anticlines east, and with a rare orientation: their steepest sides face east, and gentler slopes to the west. This unusual location and orientation make it a natural landmark visible from three counties. Today Rabbit Mountain stands along this divisive uplift between the Saint Vrain drainage basin (south) and Big Thompson drainage basin (north). Here the Great Plains meet the Rocky Mountain upslope, a rich ecological juxtaposition that brings plant and wildlife communities together from each. White tail deer, mule deer coyote, elk, fox, rabbit, raptors and rattlesnakes all call this area home. The Eagle Wind Trail - a lollipop loop - leads up and around the west slope of Rabbit Mountain with terrific views across the Eastern Plains, Front Range and Continental Divide.

Continue over the service road (which provides access to the Indian Mesa Trail) to the beginning of the Eagle Wind Trail Loop (1.0 mile : 5,802'). The following description travels clockwise on the loop: The trail levels atop a sparsely treed mesa with rangy panoramas of the Front Range, Continental Divide and Eastern Plains. Mountain mahogany, ponderosa and pinyon pine dot the expansive tract before you, brightened by an array of sage, switchgrass, and array of flowers. You'll merge briefly with a service road (1.45 miles : 5,825') through a wide clearing with views of Mt Meeker (13,911'), Longs Peak (14,259') and the Twin Sisters (11,428' - 11,413'). Veer off the service road (1.55 miles) and continue across the mesa. In about two miles the trail turns sharply back northwest to begin the second, lower portion of the loop. This section undulates gently through heavier brush back to the beginning of the loop (2.95 miles : 5,802').

111,Red Rocks Loop Trail,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,0.7,5460,5460,365,2,True,"Settlers' Park was named after the first American prospectors who camped in this area during the 1858-1859 winter. Upon his arrival at Ft. Saint Vrain 40 miles east, Thomas Aikins - a Missouri farmer with an eye for riches - surveyed the Boulder foothills noting the ""mountains looked right for gold"".  He broke from his Cherry Creek-bound party with a group of 24 men and pitched tents beneath the area's iconic rock formations on October 17, 1858. The men succeeded on January 12, 1859 with a large find worth $100,000 - a fortune at the time. An influx of settlers followed, cabins were built, sawmills erected and Boulder quickly grew into a bona fide mining town. The Red Rocks Trail climbs a steep hill over the original camp to a series of red rock fins born from a turbulent period of uplift and sculpted by water, wind and freeze-thaw cycle erosion. It weaves about the fins and returns to Settlers' Park Trailhead to form a .7 mile loop. From the parking lot, cross over a small bridge and follow signs to Settlers' Park Trailhead. The Red Rocks Trail rises past the first set of fins to a second and beginning of a short loop (.18 miles : 5,637').

113,Mesa Trail - Big Bluestem Trail Loop,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,4.35,5645,5645,785,2,True,"The south portion of the Mesa Trail joins the Big Bluestem Trail to form a short but varied loop through Boulder's foothills and open space. Its 2+ miles of wide tracks are well-suited for running and winter recreation, though large portions have been heavily rutted by the 2013 floods.  Visitors will enjoy good views across the eastern plains, Flatirons and mouth of Eldorado Canyon. The following description travels counter-clockwise: Cross South Boulder Creek and head northwest past connections for the Homestead and Towhee trails (.15 miles: 5,682'). The stone building to your left is the historic Doudy-DeBacker-Dunn homesite. Sylvester (Andrew) Doudy was the first settler in this area and built the original wooden portion of the house c. 1858. The Mesa Trail rises steadily past a 2nd connection for the Towhee Trail (.55 miles: 5,799') and South Boulder Creek Trail (.75 miles: 5,803') to the Big Bluestem Trail split (1.0 miles : 5,912'). Bear right on the Big Bluestem Trail, which runs under power lines before veering left onto the Upper Big Bluestem Trail (1.15 miles : 5,915'). The Upper Big Bluestem turns west up a steep, rugged gulch. Remain alert for mountain lion and bear activity in this narrow, cluttered corridor. Bears are especially active in late summer and fall as berries appear. Anticipate seasonal restrictions, and avoid running or traveling alone at dawn and dusk. The Upper Big Bluestem joins the Mesa Trail (1.9 miles: 6,276') and turns left (south) on the Mesa to continue the loop. The trail climbs steeply for a short distance before leveling through patchy forest and grassy slopes. The Mesa passes 3 connections for Shadow Canyon between 2.1 and 2.85 miles, all of which lead to South Boulder Peak. The trail crests (2.3 miles : 6,430') and tilts down for a long, steady descent on what becomes a wide, groomed service road. The road emerges from the broken forest with sweeping views of the lower foothills and eastern plains.

Bear Peak's central location within Boulder's extensive trail network offers several routing options: the following describes the Shadow Canyon-Bear Peak West Ridge route, and is recommended for its compelling scenery and lighter traffic.  This is the shortest but most strenuous route to Bear Peak (longer but more moderate routes can be formed by connecting the The Mesa Trail with either the Bear Canyon or Fern Canyon trails). There are several ways to reach Shadow Canyon - the following description follows the Towhee and Homestead Trails to Shadow Canyon, chosen for its varied terrain and lighter use: From the South Mesa Trailhead, cross South Boulder Creek and bear left on the Towhee Trail (.1 mile). The Towhee Trail rises steadily through open slopes for .5 miles, then narrows in a brushy gully beside a small stream. The Towhee Trail merges with the Homestead Trail at 1.15 miles, keeps right and continues on as the Shadow Canyon Trail. The Shadow Canyon Trail joins a fire road at 1.35 miles (6,275') - the first of three access points to the Mesa Trail. Turn left on the groomed fire road, which climbs another .7 miles to the last Mesa Trail access point and into Shadow Canyon (2.1 miles : 6,582'). Here the trail grows markedly steeper, climbing 1,967' in just 1.25 miles to the summit. The trail twists quickly on a faint path through large boulders and mature mixed pine. Use sign posts on trees for guidance. Though views are limited, the forest itself is quite pleasant. Grades moderate up to the Shadow Canyon Trail - Bear Peak West Ridge Trail split (3 miles : 8,155'). The area is badly scarred from the 2012 fires, but recovery is well under way. Turn right (north) for the last .4 mile, 305' push to the summit. This short segment scales Bear Peak's narrow SW flank, the latter stage of which is over rugged talus.

Groomed trails, mild grades, and a bucolic setting welcome runners, cyclists, birdwatchers, and skiers.  The following description begins at the Teller Farms - South Trailhead and travels north: The East Boulder Trail heads east on a wide gravel path to the Teller Lake spur (.2 miles) and bends north. It moves easily through the ranch, making several dog-leg turns along property lines before straightening out for lengthy spell (.75 miles). The path is crossed by several creeks and irrigation ditches lined by old-growth cottonwood stands, ideal places to see hawks, eagles and owls - especially in the bareness of winter. The trail passes through a cattle gate (1.95 miles) and into the Teller Farms - North Trailhead parking lot on Valmont Road (2.15 miles : 5,125'). It exits the northwest corner of the lot and traces Valmont Road for .25 miles before crossing north into the White Rocks Trailhead parking lot (2.4 miles : 5,092').  The trail officially enters the White Rocks Nature Preserve - Lower Boulder Creek Conservation Area and skirts a large pond home to a diverse waterfowl population. It continues over South Boulder Creek to the base of a ridge comprised of the eponymous white rocks and forks left (3.45 miles : 5,085'). The trail narrows and begins a moderate climb with panoramas of Boulder's front range, and useful perspective on the patchwork landscape through which you're passing. Look for prairie dogs, fox, coyote, rattlesnakes and burrowing owls in the prairie. The trail crests (4.35 miles : 5,230'), crosses a residential access road (4.4 miles : 5,221') and resumes an undulating course through a subtly textured expanse. You'll reach the Gunbarrel Hill - 95th Street junction (4.45 miles : 5,205') and turn left on the East Boulder Trail (a right turn leads to alternative access on 95th street).

One lengthier option joins the Belcher Hill Trail - the Park's longest - with the Rawhide, Longhorn and Whippletree trails for a varied lollipop loop across White Ranch.  The following description begins on the Belcher Hill Trail from the East Access Trailhead and travels clockwise: The Belcher Hill Trail runs NW across the foothills to a small creek (.65 miles : 6,260') and the Whippletree Trail split (1.15 miles : 6,510'). It turns sharply SW and begins a steep, winding climb into the foothills. Views improve on a westerly bend and methodical climb past connections for the Longhorn Trail (1.85 miles : 6,870'), Mustang Trail (2.4 miles : 7,245'), Roundup Trail #1 (2.55 miles : 7,285'), Roundup Trail #2 (2.8 miles : 7,385'), Maverick Trail (2.85 miles : 7,420') and the Sawmill Trail (2.95 miles : 7,462'). The ponderosa park through which you're passing is home to deer, elk, turkey, coyote, bear, rabbit, hare, porcupine, mountain lion and bobcat. Note greater tree densities and the introduction of fir and of aspen as you climb. The Belcher Hill Trail narrows past the Sawmill Trail, pushing steeply to a west-facing rim near the trail's highest point (3.65 miles : 7,840'). Here you'll enjoy rangy views across wide valleys and distant peaks. The trail comes to the second Mustang Trail junction (3.77 miles : 7,855') and turns north, dropping steeply in a heavy forest to the Park's west parking lot on Belcher Hill Road (4.12 miles : 7,650'). Cross the road and parking lot and continue downhill to the Belcher Hill Trail's terminus at the Rawhide Trail junction (4.5 miles : 7,465'). Bear right on the Rawhide Trail for an easy jaunt to the Park's main West Access parking lot (4.8 miles : 7,485'), where you'll turn left to remain on the Rawhide Trail. The Rawhide Trail heads NE and eases on the edge of a vast meadow framed by 9,000' peaks. This diverting stretch leads to the Longhorn Trail junction (5.05 miles : 7,425'); turn right (east) on the Longhorn Trail to begin the second half of the loop. The narrowly cut Longhorn Trail negotiates lengthy and intermittently steep stretches of open hillsides, pine stands and rocky outcrops. The twisting descent passes connections for the Maverick Trail (5.55 miles : 7,235') and Shorthorn Trail (6.05 miles : 6,968'), before dropping into a ravine (6.85 miles : 6,348'). It climbs out and begins a series of moderate undulations across the lower foothills to the Whippletree Trail split (6.95 miles : 6,475'). Bear left on the Whippletree Trail to complete the loop (it's worth noting the Longhorn Trail veers sharply right and uphill at this point, a counter-intuitive change in direction clouded by a poorly positioned sign).

The Belcher Hill Trail is White Ranch's longest and most connected, an ideal starting point for any route across the Park.  The Belcher Hill Trail runs northwest across the foothills to a small creek (.65 miles : 6,260'). Note the uniquely shaped foothills around you. Tectonic forces related to the greater Rocky Mountain uplift created ripples that forced rock layers to bulge and compress at the base, creating anticlines - or convex folds on the earth's surface. As the bulging anticline's softer sediments eroded, only hard ridges - known as Hogbacks - remained from the previously rounded hilltops. Good examples of this can be seen to the north as you climb. The trail moves easily to the Whippletree Trail split (1.15 miles : 6,510') and turns sharply SW on a winding, moderately strenuous push into the foothills.

This transition zone between foothills and montane forest spans a diverse tapestry of meadows, ponderosa parks and mixed conifer home to deer, turkey, fox, bobcat, bear, deer, elk and mountain lion. Mild trail conditions are well-suited for hiking, running, biking, horses, camping and winter recreation. The Rawhide Loop begins from the West Access Trailhead - the following description travels counter-clockwise: The trail heads northeast on the edge of a vast meadow with rangy views across rolling hills and surrounding mountains. It passes the Longhorn Trail split (.27 miles : 7,425'), curls north and begins a rugged, moderately steep descent into a gulch at the first of two Wrangler Run Trail connections (.65 miles : 7,125'). The trail rises back and levels briefly with views across the Eastern Plains and Denver skyline (1.05 miles : 7,315'). It gradually bends northwest and resumes a quick pace through intervals of steep undulations and relaxing flats. Travel eases along a high ridge and service road in the Rawhide Trail's northeast corner (1.95 miles : 7,450'). Here you'll enjoy views across the Loop's inner meadows and southwest mountains that frame it. Continue past the Water Hole Trail spur (2.05 miles : 7,465') - which leads to the Sourdough Springs Equestrian Camp - and veer off the service (left) to remain on the Rawhide Trail.

This trail follows the Old Fruita Dugway, a pioneer-era road built in the 1880's used to drive cattle between the nascent towns of Fruita and Glade Park. The trail follows Black Ridge, whose elevation affords brilliant views in almost every direction. Visible from the ridge are the Bookcliffs formation, Grand Mesa, Canyonlands National Park in Utah as well as the San Juan Mountains over 80 miles to the southeast. Starting from the trailhead across Rim Rock Road from the Visitor's Center, the trail begins a brief yet sharp ascent up the Old Fruita Dugway, now a gravel fire road. At about .5 miles, the trail levels out as you leave Colorado National Monument and enter land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). This boundary is marked by a signed fence letting you know that you are no longer in the park.  Shortly after entering BLM land, the trail heads west up a sandstone bench lined with Juniper trees. The Juniper trees' long, thick roots grow directly out of and into the sandstone, illustrating their amazing resilience to harsh climates. Views of the Bookcliffs and Grand Mesa are particularly good along this stretch. At the 1.1 mile mark, the trail levels out and enters a Juniper - Pinyon Pygmy forest. In this area, Juniper and Pinyon Pine trees grow very short, thus the name 'pygmy' forest. At 1.5 miles, the forest opens up to reveal wide open grass plains dotted with Sagebrush, Juniper and Pinyon Pine trees. These grasslands and sage flats are a welcome contrast to the red-rock that dominates the lower canyons of the park. Shortly after the land opens up, at 1.8 miles, the McInnis Canyons National Conservation Area is visible to the west. Controlled by the BLM, this area greatly illustrates the striking landscape of Colorado canyon country. Multi-hued sandstone fills this gorge and it is worth stopping for a moment to spot for wildlife. Continue hiking past the McInnis Canyons overlook. After crossing a white sandstone bridge, you re-enter the beautiful, wide-open grasslands of the Colorado Plateau.  Climbing steadily now, 'badland' formations begin to reveal themselves at the 2.7 mile mark. Red and green hued sediment appears to be breaking out of the grassy hillsides creating formations similar to those found in Badlands National Park. At 2.9 miles (6,520') the trail re-enters the Colorado National Monument via a chained gate. Steps are provided to hop over the wooden fence, or a linked chain can be unwound to open the gate. At 3.5 miles (6,560') you reach the trail split for the C.C.C.

Sage and sprawling cactus beds fill this colorful expanse. The trail bends west into the lower canyon and follows a stream bed up to the Pool (1.05 miles : 5,080'). Steep stairs climb over the pool and drop back into the wash, a narrow riparian corridor hemmed by dark Precambrian rock - a sharp contrast to crimson sandstones more typical in the Monument. The trail rises up the narrow channel on modest, variously rugged grades to the First Waterfall (1.95 miles : 5,295'). The seasonal fall pours over a towering alcove into a large pool ringed by shady cottonwoods and leafy vegetation. The trail - now a primitive route - continues up the right side of the waterfall on a very steep, rugged climb to a level area in the middle canyon (2.05 miles : 5,458'). Note the trail's location here, as the exact descent point may be tricky to find on the hike back. Enjoy great views back down canyon and out toward the Book Cliffs from this high point. The route continues up canyon on a fairly well-defined boot track that negotiates intervals of thick, potentially head-high brush. Be patient with route finding and avoid placing your hands or feet where you can't see them. If off course, simply follow the central wash, a verdant line of cottonwoods, willow, grasses and pools. A progressively rugged and obfuscated path leads to the Second Waterfall (3.05 miles : 5,648'), a sunny area less likely to hold water than the first. For those continuing on, look for cairns on the right side of the wash before arriving at the waterfall. These cairns mark a steep climb above/around the waterfall, which is typically not scalable due to pitch and wet rock. Anticipate slow travel beyond this point, and plan resources accordingly.",243.316666667
129,Liberty Cap,colorado-national-monument,10.4,6508,5902,-606,3,False,"Liberty Cap is located 5.2 miles from Rim Rock Drive in Colorado National Monument. This large sandstone dome along the Ute Canyon rim is a 160 M year old sand dune that's been compressed into sandstone and sculpted by erosion. The Liberty Cap Trail winds gently down Monument Mesa through pinyon-juniper woodlands and open sage flats to the formation, and continues another 2 miles to its eastern terminus on Wildwood Drive. While Liberty Cap is the primary destination, lengthy slickrock benches and views over Ute Canyon are the Liberty Cap Trail's main attraction: The Liberty Cap Trail heads through a pinyon-juniper forest to the first of several open sage flats, which are good places to find wildlife (1.15 miles : 6,490'). Remain on the trail to avoid damaging biological soil crusts which cover this area. Views of Monument Canyon (north), Ute Canyon (south), and the Book Cliffs (horizon) emerge as you progress down the mesa. At 3.4 miles (6,230') a cairn-marked spur branches .15 miles north to the Monument Canyon rim, a worthwhile excursion. The trail moderates along the Ute Canyon rim (4.0 miles : 6,162') before edging back into the woodlands and dropping to a set of steep, rugged, and tightly wound switchbacks (5.05 miles : 5,982'). Anticipate drop-offs on this short section. The trail abruptly levels to Liberty Cap, located on a slickrock saddle high along the Ute Canyon rim (5.2 miles : 5,902'). Views of Grand Junction, the Colorado River valley, and Ute Canyon are exceptional from this large, open area. Morning travelers will enjoy good light over the canyon, while the afternoon provides better light on Liberty Cap. Scale Liberty Cap, or scramble over the slickrock to a series of large grottos and ledges over Ute Canyon.",274.85

The trail begins at Monument Canyon's Upper Trailhead and descends immediately along the Monument Canyon Trail. At the .2 miles, bear right at the split and onto the Coke Ovens Overlook Trail. The next .3 miles rides the rim of Monument Canyon on its way to the Coke Ovens Overlook. A colorful wall of Entrada sandstone borders your right side, while a 1000' drop borders your left. The Coke Ovens are gigantic sandstone domes formed over millions of years by erosive forces including wind, water and frost. The domes are made of Wingate Sandstone, a softer more easily erodable form of sandstone than the darker caps on top of the domes made of the more resistant Kayenta Sandstone. The overlook itself is a fenced in area on top of the Coke Ovens which is a great place to bring lunch, relax and enjoy the incredible view.  *For a wider view of the Coke Ovens, take the Monument Canyon Trail down to the canyon floor.

131,Monument Canyon Trail,colorado-national-monument,11.6,6140,4722,-1418,3,False,"The Monument Canyon Trail is the quintessence of Colorado National Monument. Rangers will tell you that if you have time for only one long trail, this is it. The trail begins at Monument Canyon's Upper Trailhead and drops 900' in just .9 miles to the canyon floor. This initial descent follows 50M years of geological history including sedimentary rock deposited during the Upper Jurassic and Upper Triassic periods of the Mesozoic Era. As you descend, you will notice several different layers, all with their own unique characteristics that helped to create these sheer walls and rock formations. The rock layers, from top to bottom: Layer 1 = Variegated sandstone and mudstone layers of the Tidwell Member of the Morrison and Wanakah Formations Layer 2 = Salmon-colored slickrock formations of the Entrada Sandstone family Layer 3 = Very resistant, darker colored and bench-forming Kayenta Sandstone Layer 4 = Towering, sheer walled and cliff forming Wingate Sandstone layer Layer 5 = The crumbly, red-brick colored rock of the Chinle Formation Below the Chinle Formation lies two types of harder metamorphic rock from the Precambrian period called gneiss and schist. Upon reaching the canyon floor, Pinyon Pine and Juniper Trees dominate the landscape as Yucca plants and Mormon Tea abound. The canyon floor is rife with Wildlife including mule deer, desert cottontail and desert bighorn sheep. If you look close, signs are life are everywhere. The trail flattens out on the canyon floor and skirts the sheer red-rock walls. At the 1.8 mile mark, the canyon opens up to reveal the giant red-rock monolith formations that give Monument Canyon its name. Within view from a distance are the impressive Pipe Organ, Praying Hands and Kissing Couple formations, all of which get closer as the trail continues. The next 1.5 miles undulate along the canyon floor with good views of Pipe Organ, Praying Hands and Independence Monument along the way. Independence Monument, a 450' high red-rock formation is where John Otto, the founder of Colorado National Monument, was married. It was he who first created this 'trail' in hopes that one day it would be made an official monument. In 1911, the area was declared an official monument. Also visible from this spot is Window Rock, an arch-like formation easily identified in the distance. Upon passing the famous monoliths, at 4.2 miles the trail begins a steady descent on its way to the lower trailhead. Look for signs of Desert Bighorn Sheep along this stretch, as they are frequently spotted in this area of the monument. At 5.0 miles (4,768') the trail levels past a sign-in sheet for the lower Monument Canyon trailhead. It bears left and follows a barbed-wire fence with residential homes off to the right to the terminus at the lower Monument Canyon Trailhead (5.8 miles : 4,722').",267.633333333
132,Ute Canyon Trail,colorado-national-monument,8.0,6440,5570,-870,3,False,"The Ute Canyon Trailhead is located on Rim Rock Road, 9.5 miles from the visitor center in Colorado National Monument. The Ute Canyon Trail drops 515' in just half a mile to the canyon floor, where an unimproved but well-defined route leads through a fecund riparian corridor to the Corkscrew Trail in the lower canyon. The 4 mile trail is highlighted by lush and varied vegetation, stunning sandstone walls and abundant wildlife. Those with time may continue .9 miles on the Corkscrew to Liberty Cap, a 160 million year old lithified sand dune along the north canyon wall: The trail drops steeply from Rim Rock Drive on tightly wound switchbacks to the upper canyon floor (.5 miles : 5,925'). Grades level considerably here and remain so much of the way. A well-cut track turns south (right) and follows the main streambed through dense intervals of cottonwood, willow and tall grasses, a great stretch to see birds and bedded down mammals. The trail runs up and down a knoll to circumvent Precambrian gneiss slots at 1.0 mile (5,919'), depositing you back in the main streambed at a major dogleg (left) in the canyon (1.15 miles : 5,825'). Though well-marked, take note of this decisive turn for the return hike. A clear path continues down-canyon through a diverse collection of pinyon, juniper, sage and native grasses. Mature cryptobiotic soil crusts cover the ground, an essential element to desert life. Cryptobiotic soil is a living ground that conducts photosynthesis and fixes nitrogen used by other plants. When wet, Cyanobacteria moves through the soil and binds particles, forming a fibrous mesh that stabilizes the surface, holds water and reduces wind erosion. Travel quickens through a drier and expanding landscape in the lower canyon. Look for an arch carved like a slit high up on the south canyon wall about two miles from the trailhead. You'll cross dark rock slabs at 3.5 miles (5,612'), past which contrastingly bright crimson soils lead to the first of two Corkscrew Trail junctions (4.0 miles : 5,570'). This is the official end of the Ute Canyon Trail, but you may continue .9 miles and 325' up to Liberty Cap (note most of this elevation is gained on a short section of switchbacks).

Also visible from the overlook is Window Rock, a natural widening crack in the Wingate sandstone formed by pounding erosive forces. The Window Rock Trail, like the Canyon Rim Trail, stands on a ledge of Kayenta Sandstone, a more resistant form of this sedimentary rock. Deposited over 200 million years ago, the Kayenta layer is found throughout the park on top of the Wingate Sandstone layer, which forms the sheer high walls of Monument and Wedding Canyons. Due to constant erosion, the official Window Trail is sometimes difficult to follow. However, since the area is open for exploration, the trail is almost unnecessary.",257.5
134,Exploring the Sand Sheet,great-sand-dunes-national-park,10.5,8160,7910,240,3,True,"The Great Sand Dunes cover 30 square miles at the base of the Sangre de Cristo mountains in the San Luis Valley. They're America's tallest dunes, formed through a complex interaction of geology, topography and water. While the dunes are the Park's main attraction, few venture into the surrounding Sand Sheet, which holds approximately 90% of the area's sand mass and is the largest component of the dunes' geological system. The San Luis Valley lies between the San Juan Mountains (west), and Sangre de Cristo Mountains (NE). Sediments from these mountains were carried down over millennia into the valley and covered by ancient lakes. As lakes evaporated, an expansive sand sheet remained that is the primary source of today's sand dunes. Grass and shrublands stabilize the sand sheet, which extends from the base of the dunes for many miles into the valley. This subtly rich ecosystem supports deer, elk, pronghorn, burrowing owls, coyote, and rabbit. No trails lead into the sand sheet; visitors are free to explore the open shrublands, parabolic dunes and nebkha dunes that form at the dune-sheet juxtaposition. There are several ways to access the sand sheet, each requiring cross-country travel for several miles. One route begins at the Visitor Center, and runs south down Medano Creek into vast open space at the dunes' south end. This option is arguably the easiest, but offers limited perspective. Another begins at the Entrance Station, where you may park and walk through open prairie toward / around the entire dune complex (see map for routing). This longer route offers terrific views of the dunefield, wildlife viewing, and a chance to examine all dune types in a short space (Reversing, Star, Parabolic, Barchan, Transverse, and Nebkha). Visual navigation is quite simple, though hidden undulations and extended travel through sand requires effort. Visitors are responsible for knowing private property lines imbedded within Park boundaries. Carry a detailed map, and inform Park officials of your itinerary before setting out.",223.233333333
135,Sand Dune Trail,great-sand-dunes-national-park,2.5,8085,8605,520,3,True,"The Great Sand Dunes are North America's tallest dunes, spanning 30 square miles where the San Luis Valley meets the Sangre de Cristo mountains. No trails lead into the dunes - visitors are free to explore the main dunefield, Medano Creek and outlying Sand Sheet from various access points. The shortest route begins at the main parking lot just past the Visitor Center on the east side of the dunefield, and leads over Medano Creek to the base of the dunes (.2 miles : 8,140'). From there it's an arduous climb up the Park's steepest dunes to the first ridge (.75 miles : 8,600'), which offers panoramic views across the dune field, Medano Creek, and Sangre de Cristos Mt Herard (13,297'), Cleveland Peak (13,414'), Tijeras Peak (13,604'), Kit Carson Peak (14,165') and Music Mountain (13,355') are just a few of the 35+ peaks in this range exceeding 13,000'. Those with time can aim for High Dune, located about 1.5 miles from the parking lot at 8,790' (approx). Dune Formation The Great Sand Dunes' origin is a complex interaction of geology, topography, and water.The San Luis Valley lies between the San Juan Mountains (west), and Sangre de Cristo Mountains (northeast). Over millennia, sediments from these mountains were drawn down into the valley and covered by ancient lakes. As ancient lakes in the valley evaporated, loose sediment was lifted by prevailing southwest winds toward the base of the Sangre de Cristo mountains. When sand particles can go no further, wind churns the blocked sand into very fine particles and deposits them at or near the base of the obstacle. Seasonal storm patterns bring opposing winds from the northeast, blowing new and old sand back onto itself that accumulates vertically, which account for the dunes' extraordinary height. Medano Creek recycles sand each spring along the southeast edge of the dunefield, while Sand Creek resupplies the west side. Medano Creek's heavy deposits are responsible for creating the tallest dunes, which are located directly above the creek. Vegetation on the dune perimeter (known as the Sand Sheet) has stabilized loose sediment, neutralizing growth. Photos dating back to 1874 suggest the dune footprint has changed little, despite many shifts within the established complex.",228.883333333

This strenuous north-south passage touches 4 distinct ecotones: the marshes of Coney Flats, upper montane forest, subalpine forest, and alpine tundra. Such diversity attracts a range of wildlife including moose, bear, mountain lion, deer, elk, grouse, ptarmigan, marmot, bighorn sheep and mountain goat. While few may find cause to hike the trail as an out and back (many climb to its apex and return the way they came), those who do will enjoy varied terrain and exceptional views throughout: Coney Flats is a broad expanse separating Mt Audubon (south) and St Vrain Mountain (north). Coney Creek fans out through the flat, creating marsh-like conditions in a diminutive forest. The Beaver Creek Trail rises quickly over Coney Flats with excellent views of St Vrain Mountain. It crosses a small stream (1.3 miles : 10,143') and steepens to a break in the timber revealing Mt Audubon's east ridge (1.8 miles : 10,385'). You'll clear treeline and follow large cairns into open tundra at 2.2 miles. The trail climbs steeply to the ridge top (3.28 miles : 11,366') and eases to the Beaver Creek Trail - Mt Audubon Trail split. Enjoy panoramas across Longs Peak (14,259'), Mt Meeker (13,911') and the Wild Basin Area of Rocky Mountain National Park from this point. Keep left on the Beaver Creek Trail for a fast 1.7 mile descent to its southern terminus. The trail drops steeply through open tundra until the forest reconstitutes at 3.7 miles (11,238'), past which tracvel moderates on switchbacks that lead to good views of Mitchell Lake, Little Pawnee Peak (12,466') and Mt Toll (12,979'). Switchbacks deposit you in a tall spruce forest against the south flank of Mt Audubon (4.35 miles : 10,856'); from here it's a mild .7 mile jaunt to the Beaver Creek - Mt Audubon Trailhead in the Brainard Lake Recreation Area (5.05 miles : 10,508').",104.416666667

While most visitors take a direct route from Brainard Lake, a strenuous but lightly used alternative begins from the north in Coney Flats.  Coney Flats is a broad, damp expanse separating Mt Audubon (south) and St Vrain Mountain (north). Coney Creek fans out through the flat, creating marsh-like conditions in a diminutive pine - aspen forest with active wildlife. See 4WD trailhead access notes below before starting your trip: The Beaver Creek Trail rises quickly over Coney Flats with excellent views of St Vrain Mountain. It crosses a small stream (1.3 miles : 10,143') and steepens to a break in the forest revealing Mt Audubon's east ridge (1.8 miles : 10,385'). Here it transitions through treeline, a drawn-out process with useful insight to this unique ecotone. Spruce and Fir, which grow straight and tall at lower elevations, become sparse, short and deformed near treeline. Short seasons, inhospitable weather and poor soil restrict their height, while persistent winds typically limit branch growth to the lee side. This stunted form of pine, known as krummholz, is joined by willows, mosses, sedges, grasses and flowers. Large cairns mark faint sections of trail in open tundra beginning at 2.2 miles. Grades steepen to the ridge top (3.28 miles : 11,366'), then ease to the Beaver Creek Trail - Mt Audubon Trail split (3.35 miles : 11,375'). Travel moderates along a bench (3.7 miles : 11,650') with partial views of Mt Toll, Navajo Peak, Apache Peak, Shoshoni Peak and Pawnee Peak. Steep climbing resumes on switchbacks to a saddle (4.4 miles : 12,144') with x-country access to two unnamed peaks to the north (12,706' + 12,114') . The trail curls north of the summit and levels on a saddle directly beneath it (5.15 miles : 12,700'), positioning you for the final .45 mile - 523' climb through a rugged talus field. Though your objective is now clear, the route may not be; a large cairn and talus barrier block the trail at this point. It's possible to overshoot this demarcation, but you'll quickly find yourself staring down a perilous drop to Upper Coney Lake (10,940'). Identify cairns leading up through the talus before pressing on. The path is vague, and it's likely you'll discover several alternative routes along the way.

The lake is named for the 'coney' - or pika - that inhabit surrounding talus slopes. Coney Lake sees lighter crowds than other Indian Peaks destinations because of its inaccessibility by standard car. The Coney Flats 4WD Road should only be attempted by experienced drivers with cars in good condition. Standard vehicles should park at the west end of Beaver Reservoir and walk approximately 3.4 miles to the Coney Flats 4WD Parking Area. Factor this distance when planning your trip. The following description begins at the Coney Flats 4WD terminus and trailhead: Coney Flats is a broad, damp expanse between Mt Audubon (south) and St Vrain Mountain (north). Sawtooth Mountain's distinct summit (12,304') stands due west on the Continental Divide. Coney Creek fans out through the flat, creating marsh-like conditions in a thick and diminutive pine - aspen forest. Meadows, ponds and streams dot the area, a busy wildlife corridor.

It crosses the creek (right) on a makeshift log bridge (1.35 miles : 10,124'), narrows and edges away from both with intermittent clarity. The vague trail bends sharply right through a meadow (1.7 miles : 10,334'), then circles to the right of and above a small pond (1.8 miles). Here the grade steepens up the valley's north wall to an abrupt opening at the base of a steep hill (2.05 miles : 10,435'). The trail pushes through treeline to a flat; though intermittently faint, topographical clues hint at Coney Lake's general location. Travel moderates and threads a krummholz forest (2.3 miles 10,640') to a crest overlooking a corner of the lake (2.5 miles : 10,666'). Drop (left) down a rocky path to Coney Lake (2.58 miles : 10,624'). Exploration is limited by thick willow, however one good social trail leads to Coney Lake's open SE corner where morning light, views and fishing access are quite good.

The trail scales Isabelle's inlet falls to an alpine bench in the center valley (2.9 miles : 11,083'), followed by a similar push to a second (3.15 miles : 11,273'). The landscape opens with a revealing look at Isabelle in the northwest corner of the valley. Note that a smaller, unnamed glacier lies beneath Navajo Peak's 13,409' summit to the south. Remain vigilant as the trail bends sharply south across the valley and loses clarity through marsh, willow, ponds and streams (3.2 miles : 11,295'). Conditions improve once on the valley's south side (3.45 miles : 11,360'), twisting steeply past treeline to a third bench at the foot of a glacial tarn (3.75 miles : 11,460'). The trail - now a rugged, uneven talus route marked sparingly by cairns - hugs the tarn's north side to a misty cascade (3.95 miles : 11,560'). Here it turns sharply north on a series of rugged, tightly-wound switchbacks; pay close attention to cairns, as the designated route offers the best footing through this terrain. The grade moderates and bends west on the final approach (4.2 miles : 11,915'). A direct, intuitive scramble negotiates the last talus field to Isabelle Glacier (4.35 miles : 12,025') . From these heights you'll enjoy up-close views of Navajo, Apache and Shoshoni peaks, and the finely sculpted rock pinnacles between them. You can explore the glacier itself, though caution and light treading is a must on these unpredictable and occasionally unstable surfaces.

From this central location in the valley you'll have great views that include, Niwot Ridge and Navajo (13,409'), Apache (13,441') and Shoshoni (12,967') peaks. The trail rejoins the Pawnee Pass Trail (2.6 miles) and returns to the Long Lake Trailhead (2.8 miles : 10,515').",90.0

It occupies a broad, damp flat on Mt Audubon's south flank. Mild trail conditions are well-suited for families, winter recreation and those with limited time or abilities.  Visitors will enjoy good views of surrounding peaks, abundant wildflowers, excellent fishing, and numerous outlying ponds to explore. The Mitchell Lake trail rises gently in a high subalpine forest to Mitchell Creek and the official Indian Peaks Wilderness Area boundary (.45 miles : 10,646'). It continues easily to the first of several spurs on the south shore of Mitchell Lake (.9 miles : 10,725'). Social trails lead through the soggy vicinity to more secluded outlying ponds and tributaries. Head to the northeast shore for terrific views up-valley that include Mount Toll (12,979'), Mt Audubon (13,223') and Little Pawnee Peak (12,466'). Mitchell Lake straddles an ecological transition zone between the subalpine and alpine tundra. Just below Mitchell Lake is a tall spruce-fir forest; a slight rise in elevation sees a rapidly thinning forest comprised of krummholz - a German word meaning twisted wood. Krummholz describes the stunted, irregular growth patterns of trees in the transition zone. Poor soil, thin air, strong winds, and extreme weather limit and deform growth at these elevations. Higher up the valley wooded vegetation disappears altogether, replaced by the alpine tundra's hardy grasses, mosses and lichens. Most alpine plants are perennials, some are dwarfed, but their blossoms may be full-sized. Flowering plants often have dense hairs on stems and leaves for wind protection, or pigments capable of converting sunlight into heat. Cushion plants avoid wind by growing close to the ground, and anchor themselves with long taproots. Grasses and sedges take hold in richer soil beds. Non-flowering lichens can photosynthesize above 32 degrees, and outer fungal layers can absorb more than their own weight in water. Moose are known to visit the Mitchell Lake Trail corridor in late summer-early fall after passes along the Continental Divide have cleared. Elk sometimes appear on higher ridgelines, while marmot are frequently seen amid the talus just above Mitchell Lake.",89.7166666667
144,Mt Audubon,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,7.9,10508,13223,2715,5,True,"Mt Audubon is located 3.95 miles from Mitchell Lake Trailhead in the Brainard Lake Recreation Area. It's the 6th tallest peak in the Indian Peaks Wilderness, and highest with a maintained trail up to the summit. Visitors will enjoy miles of open tundra with big views across the Indian Peaks and Rocky Mountain National Park. 65% of this trail runs above treeline. Anticipate variable weather conditions, and get an early start to avoid afternoon thunderstorms: The trail begins on a mild grade that banks sharply left at .25 miles (an important mark when snow covered) up to a break in the forest against the steep south flank of Mt Audubon (.72 miles : 10,856'). The trail turns right on steep switchbacks with expanding views of Mitchell Lake, Little Pawnee Peak (12,466') and Mt Toll (12,979'). Tall spruce give way to krummholz, willow, forbs and sedges on the rapid transition through treeline (1.4 miles : 11,238'). Anticipate rocky conditions much of the way, and lingering snow through mid-summer. The next two miles lead through steep, open tundra on a rather direct, cairn-marked route to the summit. The trail bears left at the Beaver Creek Trail split (1.7 miles : 11,375') with a good look at Longs Peak (14,259') and Mt Meeker (13,911') to the north. Travel briefly moderates across a wide flat (2.05 miles : 11,650') with partial views of Mt Toll, Navajo Peak, Apache Peak, Shoshoni Peak, and Pawnee Peak. It pushes through a few steep switchbacks (2.5 - 2.75 miles : 11,977' - 12,144') to a saddle with social routes branching off to two unnamed peaks to the north. These peaks (12,706' and 12,114') are good x-country alternatives to the busy Audubon summit, offering solitude and views across Coney Flats and Rocky Mountain's Wild Basin Area. The main trail curls north of the summit and levels on a saddle directly beneath it (3.5 miles : 12,700'), positioning you for the final .45 mile - 523' climb through a rugged talus field. A large cairn and rock barrier span the trail, a signal for you to turn left into the talus. It's possible to overshoot this demarcation, but you'll quickly find yourself staring down a perilous drop to Upper Coney Lake (10,940'). Identify cairns before heading into the talus. The path is vague at best - even with cairns' guidance - and it's likely you'll discover several alternative routes along the way. Proceed cautiously and follow the most direct path to the summit (3.95 miles : 13,223'). Enjoy wide ranging panoramas, an up-close look at neighboring Paiute Peak (13,088') and 8 rock wind shelters on Mt Audubon.",89.85
145,Mt Toll,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,9.1,10525,12979,2454,5,True,"Mt Toll (12,979') is located 4.55 miles from Mitchell Lake Trailhead in the Brainard Lake Recreation Area. Though no maintained trails reach Mt Toll, well-established cross-country routes lead approximately two miles past Blue Lake (11,355') to the summit. The routes are not technical when free of snow, but still physically demanding and should only be attempted by experienced hikers. Visitors will enjoy several lakes, abundant flowers and miles of open alpine travel on the hike to Mt Toll: The trail moves quickly to Mitchell Lake, which occupies a damp flat at the base of Mt Audubon (.85 miles : 10,725'). It crosses Mitchell Lake's inlet (1.1 miles) and steepens into the center of the valley above several outlying lakes. Look for moose in this willow-lined corridor. The trail undulates through treeline to a wide cascade and crests just above the east shore of Blue Lake (2.55 miles : 11,355'). Blue Lake fills a large rock basin framed by Little Pawnee Peak (south), Mount Toll and Paiute Peak (west) and Mt Audubon (north). Here the maintained trail ends and you must choose your route to Mt Toll, determined by which shore of Blue Lake you'll climb to reach the upper valley. Ultimately you'll need to be in the southwest corner of the valley for a non-technical ascent, so the most direct approach is up the south shore. The north shore route is longer but more scenic, highlighted by Upper Blue Lake and long stretches of open snowfields. The following description scales the north shore of Blue Lake into the upper valley: Follow the social trail around Blue Lake's north shore to begin the first climb (2.75 miles : 11,379'). Though marked by cairns, thick brush, snow and talus make the exact path difficult to follow. Keep an intuitive heading into the upper valley, which widens considerably as you progress. The cross-country route levels on a wide, rocky bench about 100 yards from Upper Blue Lake (3.35 miles : 11,901'), which fills a rocky depression between Mt Toll and Paiute Peak. Here you must begin making your way south across the valley. From Upper Blue Lake, scale the talus slope to the south, which crests over a massive perennial snow bowl. Drop into the bowl and aim for the southwest corner of the valley. Once across (3.95 miles : 12,090'), you must climb a near-vertical wall to reach the saddle between Little Pawnee Peak and Mt Toll. Improvise your way up, avoiding slick snow and loose rock. Travel levels on the saddle between Little Pawnee and Toll with your first glimpse over the divide (4.25 miles : 12,540'). Identify a good line up Mt Toll's south side for the .3 mile, 439' push to the summit. While the terrain is initially clear, talus quickly absorbs any path you take and requires a very careful scramble to the summit. Remain patient and steer clear of drop offs and couloirs. The Mt Toll summit (4.55 miles : 12,979') is small and pointy with one rock wind shelter. Panoramic views include Little Pawnee Peak (12,466'), Pawnee Peak (12,943'), Shoshoni Peak (12,967'), Apache Peak (13,441') Niwot Ridge, Paiute Peak (13,088'), Mt Audubon (13,223') and peaks from Rocky National Park, the Never Summer Range and Gore Range.",89.7166666667
146,Niwot Ridge,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,10.1,10515,12285,1770,4,True,"The Niwot Ridge Trail climbs 1800' from the Long Lake Trailhead to a narrow, divisive ridge between the South St Vrain Creek and North Boulder Creek drainages. The latter is part of the Boulder Watershed, a string of six glacier-fed alpine lakes providing the balance of Boulder County's water supply. The Niwot Ridge Trail offers a rare glimpse down this secluded valley. The Niwot Ridge Trail passes through the 1200 hectare Niwot Ridge Biosphere Reserve, established in 1979 for the study of alpine tundra. Visitors will enjoy diverse alpine landscapes, good trail conditions and arguably some of the best views in the Indian Peaks: The trail follows a level path to the Jean Lunning Trail (.2 miles) and veers left over Long Lake's outlet. It continues clockwise to an unmarked split (left) for the Niwot Ridge Cutoff Trail (.4 miles : 10,558'). The trail enters a spruce forest at the base of Niwot Ridge and climbs methodically up its north face on long, winding switchbacks. This section is well-defined but can be obstructed by deadfall and snow. The trail clears treeline (1.65 miles : 11,220') and moderates through open tundra to the first of two Niwot Ridge Biosphere Reserve markers (1.75 miles : 11,275'). Here it bends decisively south for a saddle in the lower, eastern portion of the ridge. Behind you (north) are views of Longs Peak (14,259'), Mt Meeker (13,911') and Mt Audubon (13,223'); to the east a good look over Left Hand Park Reservoir. Look for ptarmigan, marmot, elk, moose, bighorn sheep and mountain goat in the open tundra. The trail passes a second Niwot Ridge Biosphere marker (2.3 miles : 11,425'), crests on the ridge's saddle (2.6 miles : 11,460') and drops south to a 4x4 road. The valley ahead is part of the Boulder Watershed, a chain of lakes framed by Kiowa Peak (13,276') and Arikaree Peak (13,150'). The trail fades but is adequately marked by cairns to its convergence with the road and official Niwot Ridge Trail (2.9 miles : 11,407'). The road-trail rises steadily up the south-side of Niwot Ridge with great views across the open tundra and valley below. Watershed boundary markers and research facilities line the way for guidance. In 4.1 miles the trail bends north for the ridge's high, narrow center with simultaneous views of the Watershed and South St Vrain Creek valleys. Perennial snow clings to upper valley walls, the water system's primary benefactors. Navajo Peak (13,409'), Apache Peak (13,441'), Shoshoni Peak (12,967') and Isabelle Glacier (12,025') emerge to the west and north as the trail levels on the ridge top. The trail reaches the last research post and cairn marking its unofficial end (5.05 miles : 12,285'). You may continue west to Navajo Peak and the Divide, or roll north for a look over the Isabelle Glacier valley. Honor the Watershed boundary, which extends all the way to the Divide.",90.0
147,Paiute Peak,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,8.6,10525,13088,2563,5,True,"Paiute Peak (13,088') is located in the Indian Peaks Wilderness between Mt Audubon and Mt Toll. No trail reaches the summit, however two non-technical routes from the Mitchell Lake Trailhead offer access.  The first and longer route scales Mt Audubon on a well-maintained trail, and continues along its rugged west ridge to Paiute Peak. There's some class III scrambling on this approach, but most find it on par with other ascents in the area. The second follows a moderate trail to Blue Lake, and a more challenging social route to Little Blue Lake. From here you must locate a steep couloir that climbs 850' in just .4 miles to the summit. No matter how you tackle it, Paiute Peak offers exceptional views of its two iconic neighbors, and across the northern Indian Peaks, Coney Lake valley and Rocky Mountain National Park. The following description takes the Blue Lake route, preferable for its more varied alpine terrain and freedom from trails after a shorter distance: The trail moves quickly to Mitchell Lake, which occupies a marshy flat at the base of Mt Audubon (.85 miles : 10,725'). It crosses Mitchell Lake's inlet (1.1 miles) and steepens into the center of the valley above several outlying ponds. Look for moose in this willow-lined corridor The trail undulates through treeline to a wide cascade and crests just above the east shore of Blue Lake (2.55 miles : 11,355'). A well-defined trail continues along and up the north side of Blue Lake for a short time before losing clarity in the open landscape. Cairns offer guidance, but rugged terrain will likely force some improvisation up to Little Blue Lake at the base of Paiute and Audubon (3.25 miles : 11,833'). The couloir you must find is located directly above the steep talus slope on the far side of Little Blue Lake. You can take this difficult section head-on, but it's easier to follow a longer route up a ridge that wraps the south side of the lake (3.65 miles : 12,059'). This uneven section levels in the valley's upper basin, where at least one large cairn marks the base of the correct couloir on the southeast face of Paiute Peak (3.88 miles : 12,238'). From here it's nothing fancy - just a very steep push on loose scree and sand until reaching terra firma in a rocky notch with views west of the Divide (4.15 miles : 12,843'). The ground stabilizes while threading talus up to a second notch with a great look at Longs Peak. Continue the intuitive scramble up to Paiute Peak (4.27 miles : 13,088'). Views are incredible from the summit, notably of Upper Coney Lake and Coney Lake (north), Mt Audubon (east) and Mt Toll and Pawnee Peak (south across the valley). Paiute Peak has a distinct cleft summit, with the summit register located on the first 'lobe'. Keep track of your route to the summit, because the couloir may be tricky to locate on the return - any other route can prove difficult if not dangerous. On the descent, anticipate sliding rocks and be prepared to get out of your own way. It's also possible to return via the Audubon ridge, which is easy to identify. This adds nominal distance and forms a great loop back to Mitchell Lake Trailhead. Be mindful of time on the exposed and slow-going Audubon ridge if weather approaches.",89.7166666667
148,Pawnee Lake,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,12.8,10515,10877,362,5,True,"Pawnee Lake is located 6.4 miles from Long Lake Trailhead in the Indian Peaks Wilderness. It lies at treeline west of the Continental Divide in a steep-walled valley below Pawnee Pass. Pawnee Lake is accessible from Monarch Lake (west of the Divide) via the Cascade Creek Trail, but the east-west route from Brainard Lake offers a decidedly more scenic trek that includes Long Lake, Lake Isabelle, Pawnee Pass and four miles of spectacular travel over treeline. It follows the Pawnee Pass Trail up to the Divide, then drops 1665' in just 1.85 miles to the lake. The trail is strenuous in both directions, particularly the climb from Pawnee Lake back to Pawnee Pass. Backpackers will have little trouble timing their ascent to avoid weather, but day hikers should plan for a strenuous day that may include waiting out storms before it's safe to return: The trail moves quickly up the north shore of Long Lake past two connections for the Jean Lunning Trail (1.2 miles : 10,674'). Travel steepens (1.85 miles) in a thinning forest to Lake Isabelle and the Pawnee Pass Trail split (2.1 miles : 10,892'). The Pawnee Pass Trail climbs steeply over Lake Isabelle on a shifting path that clears treeline and edges to the north side of the valley (2.8 miles : 11,425'). It briefly moderates across an alpine bench (3.5 miles : 11,770') with exceptional views that include Navajo Peak (13,409'), Apache Peak (13,441') and Shoshoni Peak (12,967'). Methodical climbing resumes on switchbacks up the north valley wall (3.6 miles : 11,883') before leveling in open tundra to Pawnee Pass and the Continental Divide (4.55 miles : 12,541'). A few steps ahead lead to astonishing views down the west side, and the beginning of a precipitous descent through rugged talus into the capacious Pawnee Lake valley. Rock yields to flower-riddled slopes through 5.4 miles (11,700') across more even terrain. The forest gradually reconstitutes by 6.1 miles (11,150'), where you'll find spurs that branch off for the lake. Backpackers may find established sites off these social trails, but it's otherwise advisable to remain on the designated trail, which offers the most efficient path. Thicker timber signals proximity to the lake, which is now hidden from the trail. Look for a cairn marked spur at 6.37 miles, which veers left to Pawnee Lake (6.4 miles : 10,877'). The lake is hemmed by steep south and west walls, but its east shore is long and accessible, albeit with minor encumbrances. Campers may find more accommodating terrain just above the lake.",89.9833333333

It spans a broad saddle on the Continental Divide above the South St Vrain Creek drainage (east), and Cascade Creek drainage (west).  The trail is highlighted by stops at Long Lake, Lake Isabelle, abundant flowers and miles of open tundra. Pawnee Peak is a moderate .5 mile, 400' climb from Pawnee Pass with terrific views across the Indian Peaks and Wild Basin Area of Rocky Mountain National Park: A level path follows the north shore of Long Lake to the first Jean Lunning Trail connection (.2 miles : 10,524'). It undulates past a second connection (1.2 miles : 10,674') to a clearing with a glimpse of the upper valley (1.6 miles : 10,716'). The trail steepens (1.85 miles) in a thinning forest to Lake Isabelle and the Pawnee Pass Trail split (2.1 miles : 10,892'). Lake Isabelle is framed by Navajo Peak (13,409'), Apache Peak (13,441'), Shoshoni Peak (12,967') and Isabelle Glacier (12,025'). The Pawnee Pass Trail breaks NW and climbs steeply over Lake Isabelle on twisting switchbacks. Anticipate some quick turns and faint sections on the transition through treeline (2.75 miles (11,355'). Travel moderates across an alpine bench overlooking the Lake Isabelle valley, a welcome reprieve with useful perspective on your progress and location (3.25 miles : 11,770'). Look for elk, marmot, pika, and ptarmigan in this open environment. Steep, methodical climbing resumes on rocky switchbacks up the north valley wall (3.6 miles : 11,883') to a flat expanse below Pawnee Peak (4.3 miles: 12,505'). Travel moderates to a large sign at Pawnee Pass and the Continental Divide (4.55 miles : 12,541'). This area spans a saddle between Pawnee Peak (12,943') and an unnamed peak (12,878'), both scalable with relative ease. The main trail continues west over the Divide to Pawnee Lake and Monarch Lake, 1.85 and 10 miles away, respectively. Take a few steps beyond the Pass sign to peer over the Divide at Pawnee Lake. To reach Pawnee Peak, head north from Pawnee Pass until you find the cairn-marked social trail a bit further up. The route is fairly direct and obvious, even without these cues. Views from the summit (5.05 miles : 12,943') include Mt Audubon (13,223'), Mt Toll (12,979'), Paiute Peak (13,088'), Blue Lake and Little Blue Lake. There's one rock shelter on the summit. Those with time may consider returning via the Jean Lunning Trail - a diverting loop around Long Lake with abundant flowers, accessible shorelines and excellent fishing. Doing so adds only nominal elevation gain and .4 miles to the return hike.",90.0

This versatile trail runs S-N along the eastern edge of the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area on grades ideal for hiking, running, skiing and snowshoeing.  There are several access points along the way; the following describes the Sourdough Trail's northern half between Brainard Lake Road (s) and its terminus at Camp Dick (n). The Sourdough Trail is accessed from the new trailhead facility just outside the Brainard Lake Recreation fee station: The Sourdough Trail drops gently in a subalpine forest to St Vrain Creek and the St Vrain Creek Trail split (1.15 miles : 9,732'). Note that some older map depictions of this junction are not to scale. Downhill grades moderate to the first of two Wapiti Trail access points, a winter use-only trail. The Sourdough bends NE to a large meadow and pond with good views of Niwot Ridge and several iconic summits of the Indian Peaks Wilderness (2.0 miles : 9,712'). This boggy, aspen-ringed area is a good place to find wildlife. A steep grade resumes through lodgepole to a break with views of St Vrain Mountain and the Beaver Reservoir basin ( 2. 5 miles : 9,566'). A mild descent continues past the second Wapiti Trail split (2.9 miles : 9,456'), and uneventfully to a large clearing at CR 113 and the Beaver Bog Trailhead (3.85 miles : 9,195'). Note the contrast between the thick pine forest to the south, and sparsley treed hillside to the north. This area was taken by fire some years ago, but is recovering well as flowers, grasses and aspen have sprouted in replenished soils and newly opened space. Head north from the Beaver Bog Trailhead into the burn-recovery area. The trail rises through sparse pine and young aspen to a crest with good views of St Vrain Mountain (12,162'). It levels across a dirt road (4.2 miles : 9,310') and drops to the Beaver Reservoir Trailhead on County Road 96 (4.9 miles : 9,176'). Follow trail marker #835 across the road and keep north. The Sourdough Trail moderates to a long footbridge (5.35 miles : 9,122') and enters a notably tall and diverse swath of forest (5.5 miles). It reaches a split for Coney Flats Road (6.1 miles : 8,928'), and begins a mod-steep descent to a split for Buchannan Pass Trail and Camp Dick (6.5 miles : 8,698'). Follows signs for Camp Dick, where the trail ends near Campsite #35 (6.65 miles : 8,672').",81.95
151,Buchanan Pass Trail,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,7.7,8755,9630,875,3,True,"The Buchanan Pass Trail begins at Camp Dick off Peak to Peak Highway and runs 9 miles west to Buchanan Pass (11,837') on the Continental Divide. It continues west of the Divide to the Cascade Creek Trail, which leads to Monarch Lake.  The Buchanan Pass Trail offers access to Red Deer Lake, The Gibraltar Lakes, St Vrain Mountain and Gourd Lake along it's long and varied path. Its lower eastern section traces Middle St Vrain Creek through the Indian Peaks' biologically diverse upper-montane ecosystem to Coney Flats. Visitors will enjoy minimal elevation gains and level footing in a luxuriant forest and streamside setting: From the parking area at the west end of Camp Dick, follow Middle St Vrain Road to the Buchanan Pass Trail and backcountry board (.1 mile). Bear right across Middle St Vrain Creek; once over the Buchanan Pass Trail bends west and closely parallels both for the next 3.7 miles. The trail is quickly absorbed by aspen, hanging mosses, thick ground cover and large boulders. The creek is generally accessible throughout (audible when not immediately visible), with many eddies and nooks suitable for fishing or a private respite. Conditions, scenery and difficulty vary little over the first 1.5 miles; in 1.75 miles the trail climbs more assertively to Timberline Falls (2.2 miles : 9,223'), a deep, staged gorge capped by immense boulders accessible from the trail. The falls' energetic chutes can be surveyed from above, or more intimately from two steep social trails - fore and aft - leading down to them. Exercise caution when scrambling about, as all viewpoints are generally slick, drop-offs long, and currents perilously swift. The trail moderate past the falls, crosses a dilapidated foot bridge (2.85 miles : 9,335'), and rises to an abrupt opening on the edge of Coney Flats (3.35 miles : 9,530'). Coney Flats is a marshy expanse of diminutive pine and aspen separating Mt Audubon (south) and St Vrain Mountain (north). Wildlife viewing is good in this rich habitat, notably for moose in late summer. The trail crests in a small talus field with views of Sawtooth Mountain (12,304') and undulates gently back to the creek and completion of the Buchanan Pass Trail's first segment (3.85 miles : 9,625'). Here a long bridge connects back to the 4x4 road on which you initially began; the Buchanan Pass Trail continues west on a circuitous route through Coney Flats and over the Continental Divide with connections to St Vrain Glacier, St Vrain Mountain (12,162') and Red Deer Lake (10,372').",88.4166666667

The plurality is subjective, as the two main lakes are separated by only a thin band of sedge and talus, making it possible to view, explore and even fish both simultaneously. While the Forest Lakes Trail corridor is moderate, travel is considerably more difficult on a steep, eroded trail that breaks west up Arapaho Creek to its source at the lakes. Challenging terrain and navigation keep crowds light, making this an ideal choice for equipped hikers during peak summer months: Follow signs right (north) of Moffat Tunnel to the South Boulder Creek Trail; stay on this trail and be mindful of adjacent private property. It rises west of the tunnel through mixed forest and glades to the Arapaho Lakes - Forest Lakes Trail split (1.25 miles : 9,555'). The Forest Lake Trail bends north to a bridge over Arapaho Creek (1.75 miles : 9,877'). Once over it enters a thick spruce-fir forest and steepens beside the creek to a second Arapaho Lakes - Forest Lakes Trail split (2.3 miles : 10,185'). Anticipate this point, as the sign may be knocked down. Turn left down to Arapaho Creek. Note that social trails in this vicinity may lead to the creek, but not the precise crossing. The exact point is important to find as what lies beyond lacks clarity. The trail crosses the creek on a dilapidated bridge to the west bank (2.65 miles : 10,299'), and levels north for a short time before making a decisive turn west that begins a strenuous push up-valley. This vague, cluttered segment climbs nearly 650' in just .5 miles along Arapaho Creek. It's likely that you'll lose track once or twice, but easy to regain so long as you stay in audible range. A sudden left-right switchback (2.95 miles : 10,686') signals proximity to more moderate terrain. In 3.2 miles (10,985') the forest thins and travel eases in the upper valley. A better path rises through treeline and bends sharply south across the upper-valley on a final push to the first Arapaho Lake. The main trail deposits you on its NE corner (3.55 miles : 11,172'), from which obstacle-free paths lead to higher points and the second lake. A low ridge over the first lake's east shore yields terrific views and a glimpse of the second, which lies .3 miles west and nearly flush with the first. Walk the first lake's flat south shore to the second, which fills a placid bowl directly below the Divide.

They offer excellent fishing and diverse backcountry camping experiences apart from the crowds. A maintained but potentially ill-defined trail breaks NW off the East Portal's main artery to lower Crater Lakes, a scenic pair separated only by a thin, elevated ridge. A third lake is concealed by timber nearby, accessible by following either the lower lakes' outlets or established social trails. A strenuous route continues west up a steep wall to the talus-bound cirque of upper Crater Lakes. Carry a good map to maximize time in this feature-filled basin. The following description details mileage to the first set of lakes, followed by general routing to the third lower lake and two upper lakes: Follow signs right (north) of Moffat Tunnel to the South Boulder Creek Trail; stay on this trail and be mindful of adjacent private property. It rises past the tunnel through intervals of aspen, spruce and meadow to the Arapaho Lakes - Forest Lakes Trail split (1.25 miles : 9,555'), and steepens up rugged terrain to the Crater Lakes Trail split (1.85 miles : 9,930'). The Crater Lakes Trail bends north and twists steeply up a cluttered forest. In 2.3 miles (10,095') it banks sharply right, then left on switchbacks marked by rather anonymous cairns; it continues through a slot between two large boulders and exits left to regain the trail. Rugged terrain resumes to a footbridge (2.45 miles : 10,240'), past which travel moderates in stages in a thinning forest to a trail sign along the south lake's outlet stream (2.85 miles : 10,543'). The trail leads north over the outlet to a thin, elevated band of spruce separating the two main lower lakes (2.9 miles 10,630'). Spurs branch off through tightly-spaced trees to the respective lakes - 3.0 miles : 10,575' (south) and 3.05 miles : 10,600' (north). The south lake is narrow and hemmed by steep walls and timber; in contrast the north lake is large and accessible. Social tracks circle the lake to wide views of the basin and good lakeside campsites. The outlets of each lower lake can be traced east to a third Crater Lake hidden from the main trail. To reach it, backtrack on the main trail to the aforementioned trail sign and follow the stream a few hundred yards east. There are also several social trails in the area leading to this lake. No maintained trail leads to upper Crater Lakes, however you can follow the northern-lower lake's inlet to them. The route is very steep and may be impassible when wet or iced over. Scale the steep wall on the west end of the lower northern lake. The climb levels off at the foot of a large talus field, from which you'll see the upper lakes and a direct (albeit difficult) line to them. Allow extra time for route-finding and negotiating rugged talus around the lakes.",87.45
154,Forest Lakes,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,7.8,9211,10852,1641,3,True,"The Forest Lakes are located 3.9 miles from East Portal Trailhead in the James Peak Wilderness. The first lake occupies a marshy flat below treeline; the second, much larger lake fills a deep bowl at treeline below Rollins Pass and the Continental Divide. There are several outlying ponds that require off-trail navigation to reach. A short trail runs down from Rollins Pass Road to the upper lake, though access is limited by difficult driving conditions and occasional closures. Hikers and runners starting from East Portal will enjoy moderate grades, abundant flowers and excellent fishing on the way to Forest Lakes: Follow signs right (north) of Moffat Tunnel to the South Boulder Creek Trail; stay on this trail and be mindful of private property. A wide path rises west of the tunnel through mixed forest and glades to the Arapaho Lakes - Forest Lakes Trail split (1.25 miles : 9,555'). The Forest Lake Trail bends north to a bridge over Arapaho Creek (1.75 miles : 9,877'). Once over it enters a thick spruce-fir forest and steepens by the creek to a second Arapaho Lakes - Forest Lakes Trail split (2.3 miles : 10,185'). The trail continues north in a thinning forest on a faint, shifting path to a footbridge over the outlet of Forest Lake #1 (3.15 miles : 10,664'). It follows the stream through a marsh to the south shore of Forest Lake #1 (3.25 miles). Most of the lake is accessible - the south and east sides shaded while the north is an open meadow. The lake is relatively small and easy for anglers to circle. Contrary to some map depictions the main trail continues up the west side of Forest Lake #1. It rises then drops to wooden planks over a marshy inlet (3.4 miles), then turns sharply uphill on a rugged path. The narrow, uneven trail negotiates minor obstacles and a small talus field (3.55 miles : 10,767') while veering away from the stream to its apogee (3.8 miles : 10,883'). Here it drops through a dismantled forest to the northeast corner of Forest Lake #2 (3.9 miles : 10,852'). Much of the shore - though rugged and obstructed in places - is accessible by social trail; its size and many contours afford privacy and space, even when crowded. Forest Lake's SE corner opens to a marshy meadow with good morning light, and useful perspective on the local topography.",87.45
155,Iceberg Lakes,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,11.8,9211,12115,2904,4,True,"The Iceberg Lakes are located just below the Continental Divide, 1.1 miles north of Rogers Pass in the James Peak Wilderness. No trail reaches these lightly traveled lakes, but a 5.9 mile route from East Portal Trailhead leads up Rogers Pass and along the Continental Divide Trail to a great overlook. While the lakes are exceptional, the trek itself is equally compelling. The trail passes through a verdant forest up to Heart Lake, and open tundra along the CDT with views across the Indian Peaks, Rocky Mountain National Park and Vasquez Peak Wilderness. Experienced hikers can sight-navigate down relatively moderate terrain to the lakes: Follow signs right (north) of Moffat Tunnel to the South Boulder Creek Trail. It rises past the tunnel through intervals of aspen, spruce and meadow to the Arapaho Lakes - Forest Lakes split (1.25 miles : 9,545') and Crater Lakes split (1.85 miles : 9,925'). The trail crosses two bridges over Clayton Creek (2.2 miles : 10,038') and continues steadily in a moss-draped forest to a second tributary bridge (2.6 miles : 10,235') A variously rocky and rooted climb leads to a cascade (3.48 miles : 10,742'), where it steepens to a makeshift log bridge that crosses (right) back over the creek (3.68 miles : 10,970'). The forest thins into a scenic meadow at the base of Haystack Mountain, and levels on a northwest bend to Rogers Peak Lake (4.05 miles : 11,105'). The main trail wraps the lake's east side and scales a steep ridge through treeline to Heart Lake and the Rogers Pass Trail split (4.35 miles : 11,316'). The split is not marked but the path is very clear. If not, look uphill for guideposts. The Rogers Pass Trail climbs sharply with rangy views across the Heart - Rogers Peak lakes basin. It switchbacks several times before braiding atop the Divide. All paths intersect the Continental Divide Trail, but it's advisable to follow signs off to your left. There are two signs up here - an old dilapidated one for the pass (11,860'), and a new one with trail information (4.85 miles : 11,875'). Turn north at this second sign and follow double track to the Rogers Pass Trail - Corona Trail split (5.0 miles : 11,880'). Veer right on the Corona Trail (this is the CDT), which rises over the Heart Lake cirque before moderating on a faint path in open tundra. While the trail is vague, your heading is intuitive and aided by cairns and posts. Anticipate rough bands of talus leading to the Iceberg Lakes overlook (5.9 miles : 12,115'). Views are exceptional, and it's possible to sight-navigate down relatively moderate terrain to the lakes. Only experienced hikers should attempt this route.",87.45
156,Rogers Peak Lake and Heart Lake,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,8.7,9211,11310,2099,3,True,"Rogers Peak Lake and Heart Lake are located 4.05 miles and 4.35 miles from East Portal Trailhead in the James Peak Wilderness. They occupy adjacent terraces in a large alpine basin just below the Continental Divide. The trail follows South Boulder Creek to its headwaters at Rogers Peak Lake, and on through treeline to Heart Lake. These are popular backcountry destinations with limited campsites at each lake. Backpackers should get an early start during peak season to secure space and avoid crowds: Follow signs right (north) of Moffat Tunnel to the South Boulder Creek Trail. It rises past the tunnel through intervals of aspen, spruce and meadow to the Arapaho Lakes - Forest Lakes split (1.25 miles : 9,545') and Crater Lakes split (1.85 miles : 9,925'). The trail crosses two bridges over Clayton Creek (2.2 miles : 10,038') and continues steadily in a moss-draped forest to a second tributary bridge (2.6 miles : 10,235') A variously rocky and rooted climb leads to a cascade (3.48 miles : 10,742'), where it steepens to a makeshift log bridge that crosses (right) back over the creek (3.68 miles : 10,970'). The forest thins into a scenic meadow at the base of Haystack Mountain, and levels on a northwest bend to Rogers Peak Lake (4.05 miles : 11,105'). The main trail wraps the lake's east side and scales a steep ridge through treeline to a ridge just over Heart Lake at the Rogers Pass Trail split (4.35 miles : 11,316'). The Heart Lake basin is open and easy to explore. Continue on the Rogers Pass Trail or scale adjacent slopes for aerial views over the double lake basin and Heart Lake's eponymous shape. Returning from Heart Lake via the unmaintained route: A 1.35 mile unmaintained route connects Heart Lake back with the main trail approximately 2.6 miles from the East Portal Trailhead. This short connector, which effectively makes a lollipop loop, is depicted on some maps, but difficult to follow and requires basic navigation skills. To find the trail from Heart Lake, first locate the oft-blown down Heart Lake sign on its southeast shore (GPS point below). A clear path emerges heading east and down valley from it. A sign .2 miles from the lake marks an overlook of Rogers Peak Lake. Follow this footpath on a steep descent along Heart Lake's outlet back through treeline (.6 miles : 10,950'). The trail - obfuscated and belied by numerous side trails meant to avoid obstacles - takes patience to assess. Anticipate steep, twisting, irregular intervals through 1.05 miles from the lake; the final .3 miles moderate some on a more direct line back to South Boulder Creek Trail (1.35 miles : 10,310'), just a few steps away from a recognizable bridge 2.6 miles from the trailhead.",87.45
157,Arapaho Glacier and South Arapaho Peak,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,7.9,10172,12705,2533,4,True,"Arapaho Glacier is located in the Indian Peaks Wilderness between South Arapaho Peak (13,397') and North Arapaho Peak (13,502'). Arapaho Glacier is the largest in Colorado and primary benefactor of the Boulder Watershed. It measures nearly .5 miles wide, .25 miles long, covers approximately 60 acres, and is an estimated 200' thick in its accumulation zone. Because it's still moving, geologists classify it as a true glacier. A moderate 3.95 mile trail leads from Fourth of July Trailhead to Arapaho Glacier Overlook, which spans a saddle between South Arapaho Peak and an unnamed 13,038' peak to the east. A good route continues .5 miles and 692' up to South Arapaho Peak with views across the Gore Range, Ten Mile Range, Rocky Mountain National Park and North Fork Middle Boulder Creek: The trail rises steadily past the Indian Peaks Wilderness Backcountry board (.4 miles : 10,385') to the first of several pitched switchbacks (.55 miles : 10,461'). In .8 miles the trail levels across steep, open hillsides with views across the valley of Mount Neva (12,814') and Diamond Lake's outlet waterfall. The trail narrows across the midsection of a steep waterfall (1 mile : 10,650') to the Diamond Lake - Arapaho Pass Trail split (1.15 miles : 10,752'). Bear right on the Arapaho Pass Trail, which straightens on a methodical climb up the north valley wall. It rises in a thinning forest with views over the North Fork of Middle Boulder Creek, a lush valley braided with snow-fed streams and ponds. The trail relaxes through a krummholz flat (1.65 miles : 11,110') to the Arapaho Glacier Trail split (2.05 miles : 11,236'). Bear right and cross the creek. The trail narrows and twists through dense willow and krummholz that may obscure the path. Once through treeline it straightens, steepens, and clarifies on a northeast heading into the open alpine. The trail bends NW below the summit of S. Arapaho Peak on the final run up to the glacier overlook. Arapaho Glacier Overlook (3.95 miles : 12,705') stands nearly 500' above the glacier's base. Two large tarns and a string of lakes - all part of the Boulder Watershed - form from the glacier's ablation zone. If not summiting South Arapaho Peak, consider a short distance up the eastern saddle for wider views of the glacier. The Arapaho Glacier Trail bends east from the Overlook and drops back to its terminus at the Glacier Rim Trailhead at Rainbow Lakes Campground. To reach South Arapaho Peak, continue west on a social trail toward the summit. The trail soon loses clarity amid the talus, but rock cairns and an intuitive heading will keep you on track. The trail clears 13,000' at 4.2 miles and moderates over false summits on a free scramble to South Arapaho Peak (4.5 miles : 13,397'). Two rock wind shelters and a peak finder are on the summit.",97.4333333333

It occupies a large, secluded basin 750' below the west side of Arapaho Pass. This challenging hike follows North Fork of Middle Boulder Creek to the Continental Divide, and continues steeply down shifting switchbacks to Caribou Lake. The attractive basin is braided with streams and dotted with ponds and tree-topped knolls. Much of the trail runs above treeline, and the return hike requires a strenuous climb back over the Divide. Plan travel time accordingly, and get an early start to avoid afternoon storms: The trail rises steadily past the Indian Peaks Wilderness Backcountry board (.4 miles : 10,385') to a series of pitched switchbacks (.55 miles : 10,461'). In .8 miles (10,595') the trail levels across steep, open slopes with views of Mount Neva (12,814') and its distinguished east ridge. Flowers are particularly abundant and varied on this stretch. The trail narrows across the midsection of a steep waterfall (1 mile : 10,650') to the Diamond Lake - Arapaho Pass Trail split (1.15 miles : 10,752'). The Arapaho Pass Trail continues west on a methodical climb up the north valley wall. The valley below is noteworthy, highlighted by a network of glacier-fed streams and ponds. The trail moderates through a broad krummholz flat (1.65 miles : 11,110') to the Arapaho Glacier Trail split (2.05 miles : 11,236'), and continues past the historic Fourth of July Mine into open tundra. The trail is well-defined but markedly rugged once above treeline.

Bear right on the Arapaho Pass Trail, which turns north up the saddle with great views down the west side of the Divide, and the steep, winding course you'll take to Caribou Lake. The trails crests at 3.4 miles (11,953') and turns sharply down narrowly-cut switchbacks to the rolling basin floor (4.15 miles : 11,342'). Once down it moderates on a fairly direct line to the lake. Though you may no longer see the lake, its location is fairly intuitive. The trail forks at an unmarked split (4.45 miles) and veers left to Caribou Lake (4.65 miles : 11,267'). Caribou's shore is open and easy to explore. Honor re-vegetation efforts and avoid travel in these marked areas.

It's one of the area's most popular alpine lakes, celebrated for abundant wildflowers, excellent fishing and numerous backcountry campsites.  Social trails circle the lake with panoramas of the basin and Continental Divide, and up the lake's north shore to its inlet, where a moderate x-country route leads to Upper Diamond Lake: The trail rises steadily past the Indian Peaks Wilderness Boundary (.4 miles : 10,385') to a series of pitched switchbacks (.55 miles : 10,461'). In .8 miles (10,595') the trail levels across steep, open slopes with southerly views of Mount Neva (12,814') and its distinguished east ridge. A waterfall across the valley - Diamond Lake's outlet - reveals its location, and useful perspective on the route you'll take to reach it. Wildflowers on this stretch are famously abundant by mid-July. The trail narrows across the midsection of a steep waterfall (1 mile : 10,650') and climbs to the Arapaho Pass - Caribou Pass Trail split (1.15 miles : 10,752'). The Diamond Lake Trail turns south to cross the valley and drops briskly to a bridge over The North Fork of South Boulder Creek (1.7 miles : 10,602'). A few steps upstream lead to good views of a turbulent waterfall. Wood planks run over a marsh just past the creek (1.85 miles : 10,585'); once through, the trail turns sharply uphill in a dark, north-facing forest. This steep, twisting segment may be obstructed by deadfall and lingering snow well into summer. The .65 mile, 350' climb abruptly levels in a damp meadow on the northeast edge of Diamond Lake (2.5 miles : 10,937').

Enjoy commanding views over Caribou Lake before turning left on the Caribou Pass Trail. The trail bends SW and levels in open tundra to the second of two unmarked spurs for Lake Dorothy (3.5 miles : 12,094'). The spurs are equidistant, but the second offers a more favorable approach. The intuitively followed path threads talus to the northeast shore of Lake Dorothy (3.65 miles : 12,061'). The shoreline is flat, spongy and easy to explore. Scale two hogback-like knolls east of the lake for great perspective on the lake and neighboring peaks.

The lakes are located half a mile apart in the open tundra of an isolated offshoot in a gorgeous alpine valley. Visitors will enjoy light crowds and pristine landscapes on the hike to Betty and Bob lakes:  The trail begins on a steep dirt road that merges with the South Fork of Middle Boulder Creek at the King Lake - Devils Thumb Bypass Trail split (.85 miles : 9,455'). It continues beside the creek to the Lost Lake Trail split (1.1 miles : 9,582') and eases into a meadow at the King Lake - Woodland Lake Trail split (1.3 miles : 9,600'). The trail enters a mixed pine forest and climbs steadily for the better part of 2.5 miles with little variation up the south flank of Woodland Mountain. A dense forest limits views but never fully envelops the trail. The South Fork of Middle Boulder Creek is audible much of the way, but its location remains elusive through the timber. Travel moderates in a meadow beneath Guinn Mountain's (3.85 miles : 10,437'), past which the creek and trail merge in a thinning forest. The trail abruptly banks right up a steep ridge on switchbacks (4.75 miles : 10,904') that level off near treeline at the King Lake - Bob and Betty Lakes Trail split (5.0 miles : 11,108'). The trail turns sharply north and twists steeply through tangles of krummholz, willow, and forbs. Be patient with route finding and help minimize erosion by staying on the trail. A good map with an eye on Betty Lake's outlet stream should guide you in lieu of a clear path. The trail levels on the southeast shore of Betty Lake (5.5 miles : 11,422'); it continues beside it before scaling a faint but intuitively followed path to Bob Lake (6.0 miles : 11,570'). The open tundra is fairly easy to explore and offers sweeping views of the upper-valley, King Lake cirque, and Lonesome Dove areas.

The trail continues .35 miles above King Lake to the Continental Divide, where it joins the High Lonesome Trail near Rollins Pass in the open tundra. Those with time can access Betty Lake and Bob Lake from a .5 mile spur off the main trail: The trail begins on a steep dirt road that merges with the South Fork of Middle Boulder Creek at the King Lake - Devils Thumb Bypass Trail split (.85 miles : 9,455'). It continues beside the creek to the Lost Lake Trail split (1.1 miles : 9,582') and eases into a meadow at the King Lake - Woodland Lake Trail split (1.3 miles : 9,600'). The trail enters a mixed pine forest and climbs steadily for the better part of 2.5 miles with little variation up the south flank of Woodland Mountain. A dense forest limits views but never fully envelops the trail. The South Fork of Middle Boulder Creek is audible much of the way, but its location remains elusive through the timber. Travel relaxes in a meadow below Guinn Mountain (3.85 miles : 10,437'), past which the creek and trail merge in a thinning forest. The trail abruptly banks right up a steep ridge on switchbacks (4.75 miles : 10,904') that level off near treeline at the King Lake - Betty and Bob Lakes Trail split (5.0 miles : 11,108'). Cross left over the creek, which flows heavily during runoff and may obscure the way. The trail rises quickly in a transitional alpine landscape with abundant wildflowers and rangy views back down valley. The trail is well-cut, but may be overgrown or snow-covered in places. Anticipate an unmarked spur that veers right to a small, partially hidden lake just before reaching King Lake (5.25 miles : 11,339'); those with time should explore this attractive area. A few minutes ahead another unmarked spur branches right (5.38 miles) - this is King Lake (5.4 miles : 11,430'). King Lake's east and north shores are level and accessible, but its west side is framed by the cirque's vertical headwall on the Continental Divide. The trail continues above the lake to the Continental Divide and High Lonesome Trail junction (5.75 miles : 11,657'). This location provides great aerial views over King Lake and down the South Fork Middle Boulder Creek drainage.",76.2833333333
166,King Lake - High Lonesome - Devils Thumb Lake Loop,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,14.75,9009,12105,3096,5,True,"The High Lonesome Trail connects the King Lake and Devils Thumb Lake trails to form a 14.75 mile loop through the Indian Peaks high country. The route scales South Fork Middle Boulder Creek valley to King Lake and the High Lonesome Trail on the Continental Divide. The High Lonesome rolls across open tundra for 2.5 miles before descending Devils Thumb Pass into the Devils Thumb Lake basin and past Jasper Lake along Jasper Creek to complete the loop.  The following describes clockwise travel, recommended for its milder up-valley climb and favorable lighting: The trail begins on a steep dirt road that merges with South Fork Middle Boulder Creek at the King Lake - Devils Thumb Bypass Trail split (.85 miles : 9,455'). It continues by the creek to the Lost Lake Trail split (1.1 miles : 9,582') and levels into a meadow at the King Lake - Woodland Lake Trail split (1.3 miles : 9,600'). The trail enters a mixed pine forest and climbs steadily for the better part of 2.5 miles with little variation up the south flank of Woodland Mountain. South Fork Middle Boulder Creek is audible much of the way, but its location is largely concealed by timber. Travel eases in a meadow at the base of Guinn Mountain (3.85 miles : 10,437'), past which the creek and trail merge in a thinning forest. The trail abruptly banks right up switchbacks (4.75 miles : 10,904') that level off near treeline at the King Lake - Bob and Betty Lakes Trail split (5.0 miles : 11,108'). Veer left over the creek, which can flow heavily and obscure the path. The trail rises through open airy landscapes highlighted by wildflowers and rangy views back down valley. The trail is well-cut, but may be overgrown or snow-covered in places. An unmarked spur veers right to a large pond just before reaching King Lake (5.25 miles : 11,339'); a few minutes ahead another spur branches right (5.38 miles) - this is King Lake (5.4 miles : 11,430'). The trail continues up King Lake's south cirque wall to the Continental Divide and High Lonesome Trail (5.75 miles : 11,657') with views of Corona Lake, James Peak, Gore Range and Winter Park. The High Lonesome Trail turns north and scales steep, tightly wound switchbacks over King Lake to the west of side of the Divide's apical ridge. The trail levels (6.5 miles : 11,966') with unabated views down the western slope before pushing uphill once again to its highest point (7.0 miles : 12,105'), located just behind Bob Lake. Travel moderates for .5 miles, dips to avoid willow thickets and scree (7.5 miles), then rises back to the High Lonesome Trail - Devils Thumb Trail junction (8.05 miles : 11,810'). Bear right on the Devils Thumb Trail up to Devils Thumb Pass - a thin saddle on the Divide (8.25 miles : 11,967'). The Devils Thumb Trail turns down the east side of the Divide on a steep, winding path that levels in a broad alpine flat with a large pond near Devils Thumb Lake (8.85 miles : 11,257'). Devils Thumb Lake is long and slender, bound tightly to the north by Mt Neva and its eponymous promontory. Social trails branch to various points along the shore, or you may continue on the main trail to the willow-shrouded outlet (9.25 miles : 11,138'). The trail drops steeply beside Devils Thumb Lake's outlet to a meadow and re-enters an undulating forest in the upper valley (9.75 miles : 10,908'). Travel moderates by campsites on the south shore of Jasper Lake (10.05 miles : 10,967'), and across the outlet to an access spur on the southeast shore (10.4 miles : 10,814'). The trail continues past Jasper Lake on a damp, intermittently steep and ill-defined path into the lower-valley; connections with the Diamond Lake Trail (11.0 miles : 10,675') and Woodland Lake Trail (12.55 miles : 9,792') are useful progress markers on the descent. The forest breaks at a large meadow (13.1 miles : 9,670') past the Indian Peaks Wilderness Boundary sign. It re-enters thick forest (13.5 miles : 9,625') and twists steeply down Jasper Creek to the King Lake - Devils Thumb Bypass Trail junction and conclusion of the loop (13.9 miles : 9,455').

This short, family-friendly hike is highlighted by aspen groves, waterfalls and a dramatic alpine backdrop. Visitors will enjoy good fishing and numerous backcountry campsites at Lost Lake:  The trail begins on a steep dirt road lined with aspens and wildflowers, merging with the South Fork of Middle Boulder Creek at the King Lake - Devils Thumb Bypass Trail split (.85 miles : 9,455'). The trail crosses (left) over the creek and closely follows it to the Lost Lake Trail split (1.1 miles : 9,582'). A powerfall waterfall drops through a narrow chute just before reaching this turnoff, where a number of spurs lead to creek-side viewing areas. The Lost Lake Trail turns sharply away from the creek and climbs steeply for .25 miles to the marshy west side of Lost Lake (1.35 miles : 9,786'). The main trail forks here into well-defined paths around the wooded shore. The best views and backdrops can be found on the east side, though late afternoon arrivals may find lighting more favorable from the west.

The reservoir - no longer maintained but still partially dammed - was built between 1941 and 1947 by private landowners for downstream irrigation and sold to the City of Boulder in 1966.  Visitors will enjoy excellent wildlife viewing, camping, and fishing on this varied trek through riparian woodlands, alpine meadows, and open tundra between Woodland Lake and Skyscraper Reservoir: The trail begins on a steep dirt road that merges with the South Fork of Middle Boulder Creek at the King Lake - Devils Thumb Bypass Trail split (.85 miles : 9,455'). It continues beside the creek to the Lost Lake Trail split (1.1 miles : 9,582') and eases into a meadow at the King Lake - Woodland Lake Trail split (1.3 miles : 9,600'). The trail enters a large meadow on level double track across the Indian Peaks Wilderness Boundary (1.45 : 9,611'). It follows the old wagon road through intervals of forest and meadow, first loosely, then closely beside Jasper Creek to the Devils Thumb Trail - Woodland Lake Trail split (2.35 miles : 9,747'). Note that social trails circumvent washed out areas along Jasper Creek up to this split. The Woodland Lake Trail bears left and steepens beside Woodland Creek to a footbridge (2.8 miles : 10,022'), past which the climb intensifies on a rugged, shifting path. It moderates briefly in a tranquil forest braided with streams and dotted with glades (3.2 miles : 10,395'). The oft-wet trail inches back toward Woodland Creek, rising fast to another flat (3.5 miles : 10,609'). This attractive section is highlighted by converging streams, cascades, wildflowers and mushrooms. Travel eases on an intermittently faint path, edging away from the creek to a small pond (3.8 miles : 10,737') and up the north edge of a marshy meadow in the upper valley. The trail enters a small spruce stand on the meadow's west end (4.0 miles) and emerges in open space at the base of Woodland Lake's outlet stream (4.3 miles). It levels beside the outlet to Woodland Lake, partially hidden a few dozen yards off trail by thick willow and krummholz (4.55 miles : 10,972'). The trail rises steadily up the north shore and valley wall with good views of Woodland Lake's attractive west shore. The trail crests at 4.9 miles (11,243') and drops to a clearing on the NE corner of Skyscraper Reservoir (4.95 miles : 11,220'). The lake's north side is limited by steep walls, talus and vegetation, but low water over the dam wall and some creative maneuvering lead to the more open south and west shores.",76.2833333333

It lies at treeline in a narrow valley that drains into Jasper Creek. It covers 6 acres at a maximum depth of 7', with nice openings on the west side ideal for camping and fishing. Woodland Lake sees lighter traffic than other destinations in this travel zone, a good choice during peak summer months. The trail begins on a steep dirt road lined with aspen and wildflowers, merging with the South Fork of Middle Boulder Creek at the King Lake - Devils Thumb Bypass Trail split (.85 miles : 9,455'). The trail rises along the creek to the Lost Lake Trail split (1.1 miles : 9,582') and eases into a meadow at the King Lake - Woodland Lake Trail split (1.3 miles : 9,600').

The oft-wet trail inches back toward Woodland Creek, rising fast to another flat (3.5 miles : 10,609'). This attractive section is highlighted by converging streams, cascades, wildflowers and mushrooms. Travel eases on an intermittently faint path, edging away from the creek to a small pond (3.8 miles : 10,737') and up the north edge of a marshy meadow in the upper valley. The trail enters a small spruce stand on the meadow's west end (4.0 miles) and emerges in open space at the base of Woodland Lake's outlet stream (4.3 miles). It levels beside the outlet to Woodland Lake, partially hidden a few dozen yards off trail by thick willow and krummholz (4.55 miles : 10,972'). Access and views are limited from its north shore, but crossing the narrow outlet to its southeast shore leads to grassy slopes and arguably the vicinity's best views. From this vantage you may also see the dramatic spillover from Skyscraper Reservoir (11,220') in the upper northwest corner of the valley.

170,Gibraltar Lakes,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,9.5,9655,11181,1526,4,True,"The Gibraltar Lakes lie at the base of St Vrain Glaciers near the Indian Peaks - Rocky Mountain National Park boundary. This trio forms the headwaters of Middle St Vrain Creek at the top of a spectacular alpine valley.  The following description begins at the Middle St Vrain 4WD Road terminus, 3.75 miles west of Camp Dick. Only experienced drivers with adequate clearance can complete this drive; others may either walk the road or equidistant Buchanan Pass Trail from the Middle St Vrain Trailhead at Camp Dick. Plan travel time accordingly and call ahead for road conditions: The Buchanan Pass Trail crosses Middle St Vrain Creek and bends NW through a diminutive spruce flat. It rises nominally along the creek with views of Sawtooth Mountain to the St Vrain Mountain Trail split (.7 miles : 9,832'), and continues NW in a taller forest. Timber breaks at a large clearing, a good place to camp and look for elk and moose (1.45 miles : 9,925'). The Buchannan Pass - St Vrain Glacier Trail split is located on the far side of this meadow (1.6 miles : 9,947'); keep right on the St Vrain Glacier Trail. The St Vrain Glacier Trail climbs steadily beside the creek in a healthy spruce-fir forest that opens across a short talus field (2.7 miles) to the first of several stream crossings (2.75 miles : 10,320'). Mild travel resumes south of the creek to a second (unaided) crossing over a wide but shallow section (3.05 miles : 10,412'). Once across the trail rises gently to a scenic meadow and cluster of four large ponds (3.45 miles : 10,552'). It crosses the creek (south) once again, this time on a log jam at the outlet of the first pond you come to. It continues past this marshy complex in a thinning forest with expanding views of the upper valley. The trail climbs steadily to the first break in treeline (4.1 miles : 10,790') and loses clarity amid thick willow, krummholz, lingering snow and talus. It negotiates rugged undulations to the confluence of Middle St Vrain Creek and Gibraltar Lakes' outlet stream (4.4 miles : 10,910'). Veer left (south) up a steep slope cut by the outlet. The path can be difficult to follow, but generally traces the outlet stream to the lakes. If off course, stay close to the water and aim for glaciers on the south valley wall - the lakes are located at their base (note: a small lake to the west is a nice side trip, but not your destination). The Gibraltar Lakes' outlet braids a wide slope carpeted by flowers. Though some maps show a clear path east of this outlet to the largest lake, it's actually quite faint and leads unnecessarily through talus. Take the path of least resistance beside the outlet to the first Gibraltar Lake (4.75 miles : 11,181'). Just over its south shore is a second, larger lake; east and adjacent to that is the third and largest lake. A high ridge between the lakes overlooks all three, and down Middle St Vrain Creek valley.",103.55

It lies in a slender, isolated valley between Sawtooth Mountain (south) and St Vrain Mountain (north). Mild grades, good trail conditions and fishing along Middle St Vrain Creek and at Red Deer Lake make this an ideal family and backcountry destination. The following description begins at the Middle St Vrain 4WD Road terminus, 3.75 miles west of Camp Dick. Only experienced drivers with equipped vehicles should attempt this road; others may either walk the road or equidistant Buchanan Pass Trail from the Middle St Vrain Trailhead at Camp Dick. Plan travel time accordingly and call ahead for 4WD travel conditions: The Buchanan Pass Trail crosses Middle St Vrain Creek and bends northwest through a diminutive spruce flat. The trail rises nominally beside the creek with views of Sawtooth Mountain to the St Vrain Mountain Trail split (.7 miles : 9,832') and continues northwest in a taller forest. It emerges in a large clearing (1.45 miles : 9,925') with a glimpse of the upper valley. Travel eases to the Buchannan Pass - St Vrain Glacier Trail split on the far side of the meadow (1.6 miles : 9,947'); bear left on the Buchanan Pass Trail toward Red Deer Lake. The trail promptly crosses Middle St Vrain Creek and bends sharply SE back into a thick forest that can hold snow into early summer and obscure portions of the trail. The Buchanan Pass Trail moves quickly with little scenic or terrestrial variation to the Red Deer Lake Trail split (2.6 miles : 10,115'). Two sign posts mark the split - a rather anonymous one on the north side, and more visible one just steps away on the south side. Anticipate the split, as travel is fast to this point and easy to overshoot. Turn right (west) on the Red Deer Lake Trail, where grades steepen atop a narrow ridge. The steep pitch soon moderates (2.75 miles : 10,215') in a thin forest with partial views of a shallow valley and jagged ridges to the south. The sudden appearance of aspen signals your arrival at Red Deer Lake (3.2 miles : 10,372'). Red Deer Lake's shore is a rocky tangle of willow and krummholz, however social trails ring the perimeter to good views and clearings on the open east side. Snow fed slopes to the south support a variety of wildflowers, while aspen and leafy vegetation produce brilliant autumn colors that may hold through late September.",103.55

The approach from Eldora follows Forest Road 505 through dense pine and aspen forests to high meadows on the massif, and old mining sites near the northern terminus on Caribou Road.  Good road-trail conditions are well-suited for families, runners, bikes and winter recreation. High meadows near the summit offer terrific views of the Divide and good wildlife viewing opportunties: The trail climbs steadily east through dense pine and aspen to a clearing (.9 miles) with views of lower Middle Boulder Creek Valley, town of Nederland, Barker Reservoir (east) and Tennessee Mountain (south). It bends sharply west (1.0 mile : 9,177') with a good look at the Continental Divide and Hessie Trailhead corridor. Travel steadies to a pair of switchbacks (1.55 miles : 9,460'), past which aspen give way to thick conifers draped in moss. The trail crests (1.8 miles : 9,590') and undulates for a short time before climbing nearly 480' in just under a mile to a level clearing on Caribou Flat (3.5 miles : 10,170'). This lofty expanse offers panoramic views and is generally easy to explore. The trail remains level through Caribou Flat for the better part of a mile up to a fork at 4.5 miles (10,240'); bear right towards the Caribou Town Site. The trail - now off limits to non-resident vehicles - bypasses a dilapidated shelter and rises modestly on rockier terrain. It crests one last time (4.85 miles : 10,265') and drops down the east flank of Caribou Hill to Caribou Road and the Caribou Town Site (5.3 miles : 10,040'). Here Road 505's public access resumes north on a rugged 4WD Road to Rainbow Lakes; Caribou Road leads east back to downtown Nederland, and west to the base of Bald Mountain.",71.1333333333
173,Cascade Falls (Indian Peaks Wilderness Area),indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,9.2,8345,9207,862,3,True,"Cascade Falls are accessible from the Monarch Lake Trailhead in the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area on the west side of the Continental Divide. Cascade Falls are comprised of 4 separate waterfalls spanning a .7 mile stretch of Cascade Creek, 4.6 miles from the trailhead.  A relatively mild trail follows Monarch Lake, Buchanan Creek, and Cascade Creek through mixed forests to the main falls complex, passing several other notable but unnamed falls along the way. Visitors will enjoy good trail conditions, ideal backcountry camping terrain, and diverse wildlife on the hike to Cascade Falls: The trail begins on a level path up the north shore of Monarch Lake. It moves quickly to the lake's marshy inlet (.95 miles) and enters a mixed forest at the Indian Peaks Wilderness Boundary (1.25 miles : 8,358'). It rises to the Cascade Creek Trail - Arapaho Pass Trail split (1.6 miles : 8,367') and steepens under a tall canopy badly marred by beetle kill. At 2.05 miles (8,481') the trail merges with Buchanan Creek before climbing away on steep switchbacks. It moderates past 2.5 miles and begins a long, level stretch through uniform columns of lodgepole to the Buchanan Pass Trail split (3.45 miles : 8,772'). Backcountry camping terrain is notably good on this flat segment, and well-spaced trees provide good viewing lanes for wildlife. Look for deer, moose, and bear along this verdant stretch. The trail continues over a bridge near the confluence off Buchanan Creek and Cascade Creek (3.6 miles : 8,835') and climbs to a narrow, forceful waterfall (3.75 miles). This is not Cascade Falls, but one of several unnamed ones en route to the main group. The trail rises to a long bridge at an abrupt opening in the valley (4.4 miles : 9,106'), where it crosses Cascade Creek to the first of four main falls that comprise Cascade Falls (4.6 miles : 9,207'). Note that fires and horses are not permitted beyond the bridge leading to the falls. The grade steepens considerably beside the falls, each accessible by a short spur. The trail passes the top of the fourth fall and grows markedly rugged beyond this point (5.2 miles : 9,525'). The Cascade Creek Trail continues 2.2 miles past this last fall to Crater Lake.",134.3
174,Crater Lake and Mirror Lake,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,14.8,8345,10328,1983,4,True,"Crater Lake and Mirror Lake are accessible from Monarch Lake Trailhead in the Indian Peaks Wilderness. The lakes are .2 miles apart in a deep bowl carved from Mount Achonee (12,469') and Lone Eagle Peak (11,920') on the west side of the Continental Divide.  The Cascade Creek Trail follows Monarch Lake, Buchanan Creek, and Cascade Creek for 7.4 miles to the lakes. While achievable in a day, numerous highlights and backcountry camping options warrant an overnight stay. Visitors will enjoy miles of fishable streams, Cascade Falls and abundant wildflowers on the hike to Crater Lake: The Cascade Creek Trail begins on a level path up the north shore of Monarch Lake to the Indian Peaks boundary (1.2 miles : 8,358'). Look for osprey over the lake, moose in the marshy inlet area and raspberries along the way. It rises to the Cascade Creek Trail - Arapaho Pass Trail split (1.6 miles : 8,367') and steepens under a tall canopy marred by beetle kill. At 2.05 miles (8,481') the trail merges with Buchanan Creek before climbing away on steep switchbacks. It moderates past 2.5 miles and begins a long, level stretch through uniform lodgepole to the Buchanan Pass Trail split (3.45 miles : 8,772'). Camping terrain is particularly good on this flat, verdant segment. The trail continues over a bridge near the confluence off Buchanan Creek and Cascade Creek (3.6 miles : 8,835') and climbs to a narrow, voluminous waterfall (3.75 miles). This is not Cascade Falls, but one of several unnamed ones en route to the main group. The trail rises to a long bridge at an abrupt opening in the valley (4.4 miles : 9,106'), where it crosses Cascade Creek to the first of four main falls that comprise Cascade Falls (4.55 miles : 9,207'). Note that fires and horses are not permitted beyond the bridge leading to the falls. Travel steepens beside the falls, each accessible by a short spur. The trail passes the top of the fourth fall and grows rugged beyond this point (5.2 miles : 9,525'). The forest breaks on the edge of a large meadow, one of the best places to see moose, elk and bear on this trail (5.4 miles : 9,670'). Steep climbing resumes past the meadow into a fragmented subalpine forest with expanding views of the upper valley. The trail crosses a narrow, elevated bridge over a major tributary that may be tricky when wet, or carrying large packs (6.45 miles : 9,995'). Veer right at the Pawnee Pass Trail split (6.65 miles : 10,033') and look for cairns leading over open rock slabs to backcountry campsite #1 (6.85 miles : 10,153'). Just ahead the trail crosses Cascade Creek on a makeshift bridge, 50 yards past an old bridge washed out in recent years by heavy runoff (6.95 miles : 10,153'). It's important to locate the trail over the creek before crossing. Once over, find the main trail and continue through an idyllic subalpine setting of tall glades, small meadows, braided streams, and brilliant wildflowers. This is arguably the prettiest section of the hike. The trail makes one final push up steep, shifting switchbacks to Mirror Lake (7.2 miles : 10,291'). Lone Eagle Peak looms over Mirror Lake, one of the most iconic settings in the Indian Peaks Wilderness. A number of designated campsites ring the small lake. The main trail continues in a thinning forest up the west shore of Mirror Lake to Crater Lake (7.4 miles : 10,327'). Note there are many social trails between the lakes, and it's possible to become disoriented. If in doubt, simply follow the stream connecting the two. Crater Lake occupies an immense bowl beneath Mount Achonee (12,469'), Lone Eagle Peak (11,920'), and several unnamed peaks topping 12,000'. Peck Glacier and several perennial snowfields cling to the steep-walled cirque. Social trails circle the lake, but climbing higher for additional perspective is somewhat limited by terrain and pitch.",134.3

It lies just below treeline in a large, granite bowl west of the Continental Divide. Gourd Lake is similar in appearance to nearby Mirror Lake but with lighter crowds. Though fairly long, moderate conditions make Gourd Lake achievable in a day with 2.7 miles of steady switchbacks between Cascade Creek and the lake to mitigate steep grades. Visitors will enjoy diverse terrain, berry picking and excellent fishing at Gourd Lake: The Cascade Creek Trail begins on a level path up the north shore of Monarch Lake to the Indian Peaks boundary (1.2 miles : 8,358'). Look for osprey over the lake, moose in the marshy inlet area and raspberries along the way. The trail rises to the Cascade Creek Trail - Arapaho Pass Trail split (1.6 miles : 8,361') and steepens under a tall canopy badly marred by pine beetles. It briefly merges with Buchanan Creek (2.05 miles : 8,481') before climbing away on switchbacks. Grades level past 2.5 miles to the Buchanan Pass Trail split (3.45 miles : 8,772'). The Buchanan Pass Trail pitches up and NE along Buchanan Creek in a more open forest. It moderates through 4.0 miles (9,110') past a few clearings and aspen groves. While the forest is aesthetically mundane, this versatile habitat supports a range of wildlife. The trail crosses a tributary at 4.75 miles; there's a bridge for hikers but you may choose to hop the stream in favor of this aging plank. Travel steadies to the Gourd Lake Trail split (6.0 miles : 9,583'), where you'll begin a 2.7 mile segment of long-leg switchbacks up to the lake. Despite their uninviting depiction on a topo map, these switchbacks are relatively moderate over even terrain. Lodgepole is gradually phased out from 7 - 7.5 miles on the transition to a healthier spruce-fir forest. Thinning timber and higher elevations expose ridgelines of the Divide, Cascade Creek corridor and Crater Lake cirque. Conditions grow rugged leading to a scenic pond in the upper valley (8.0 miles : 10,762'). The trail skirts it to a second pond, which is actually just a long finger of Gourd Lake's outlet channel. Here the trail loses clarity; some maps show it doubling back on itself and heading up the left side, but it's equally easy to follow the right side up to Gourd Lake (8.3 miles : 10,795'). Steep granite walls frame much of the lake and limit exploration, however social trails around the open south shore connect natural jetties that provide unique vantages and fishing access. Trout are notably large in this deep and lightly fished lake.",134.3

Its versatility as a hiking, running, horseback riding and winter sport trail make it one of the Indian Peaks' most popular year-round destinations. Much of Monarch Lake's shoreline is accessible to anglers, who seek its brook, rainbow, cutthroat and brown trout stocks. The following description travels clockwise: The trail begins on a level path up the north shore of Monarch Lake. It travels quickly to the lake's inlet (.95 miles) and enters a mixed forest at the Indian Peaks Wilderness Boundary (1.25 miles : 8,358'). Look for moose is this marshy, food-rich habitat. The trail climbs to the Cascade Creek Trail - Arapaho Pass Trail split (1.6 miles : 8,367'), and bears right into a thick forest to continue the loop. The trail is variously rugged and obstructed by deadfall over next 2 miles as it rises above the lake's south shore. Though views are fairly limited until reaching the far southwest shoreline, the forest itself is quite attractive, and good place to see deer, moose, bear, and elk. You'll cross a bridge spanning the inlet to connections for the Arapaho Pass Trail (2.3 miles) and High Lonesome Trail (2.35 miles). The trail edges back to the shoreline at 3.4 miles with good access and easterly views across the lake. It continues over Lake Monarch's outlet stream and dam to complete the loop.",134.3
177,Rainbow Lakes,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,1.9,10010,10280,270,3,True,"The Rainbow Lakes are a series of 9 lakes and beaver ponds linked across a broad flat between Peak to Peak Highway and the Continental Divide. These well-stocked lakes are popular with anglers, and the easy hike in is well-suited for families and backpackers. While the main trail doesn't reach every lake, well-defined social trails and a good map will help you explore this relatively small and accessible area.  The trail officially enters the Indian Peaks Wilderness a few dozen yards from the parking area and bears left. It rises gently through spruce and aspen to the first lake (which is more of a pond) on your left (.35 miles : 10,202'), and continues easily to a second (.6 miles : 10,230'). Two more lake-ponds are hidden by trees 100+ yards south that see fewer people. The trail passes north of a marshy meadow (.8 miles) to another small but accessible lake. It keeps west and undulates with less clarity to an elevated rock pile between juxtaposed lakes (.95 miles : 10,280'), from which social paths branch to outlying ponds in the area. The main trail continues NW of the last major lake to nowhere in particular, gradually fading in the forest along Rainbow Lakes' primary inlet. You can follow the inlet to its source at a snowfield on the drainage's headwall. Terrain is rugged but passable, easing once through a talus field at treeline. It levels on an alpine bench (1.85 miles : 10,730'), where a second push leads to a tarn with terrific down-valley views (2.05 miles).",92.9333333333
178,Stone Lake,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,12.3,8320,10643,2323,5,True,"Stone Lake is located 6.15 miles from Roaring Fork Trailhead in the Indian Peaks Wilderness. This challenging hike begins at Lake Granby and follows the Roaring Fork drainage up to Irving Hale Pass. It rolls through airy meadows before diving steeply into Hell Canyon and rising back to Stone Lake. Upper Stone Lake is located .4 miles ahead at the top of Hell Canyon between Hiamovi Mountain (12,395') and Cooper Peak (12,296'). The lakes are aptly named for large rock features that form the basin, though the lakes themselves are surrounded by gentle terrain ideal for camping and exploration. Stone Lake sees less traffic than nearby Mirror, Crater and Gourd lakes, primarily for the degree of difficulty. The Stone Lakes compare favorably to each, with greater diversity along the way: The trail runs level around Pete's Cove to the IPW Boundary (.18 miles), past which it climbs 810' in just .8 miles to a bridge across the Roaring Fork (1.0 miles : 9,172'). Enjoy views of Lake Granby and a colorful mix of aspen and thimbleberries on this challenging segment. Travel eases up the north side of the creek in a mixed forest marred by pine beetles (1.5 miles : 9,295'). Despite extensive damage, the herbaceous layer is healthy and diversely vegetated. The trail rises in short spurts to bridges at 2.35 miles and 2.58 miles into a damp clearing at the Lake Watanga Trail split (2.65 miles : 9,805'). There's good camping in this area, and the last level terrain before reaching the pass. The Roaring Fork Trail splits right up the south valley wall on a steady, leg-burning climb in a healthier forest. This shaded north-facing slope can hold snow well into June and make travel difficult, especially with heavy packs. Grades finally moderate across the first of several large glades (3.7 miles : 10,855') that open to airy meadows on Mount Irving Hale Pass (4.1 miles : 11,195'). This is a great place to camp, explore and look for wildlife - particularly elk. It's also a fine turnaround point if not aiming for the lakes. Mount Irving Hale (11,754') stands prominently above, which can be scaled for rangy views over the meadows and Hell Canyon. Berry patches cover the area, and peak in late September. The trail rolls through open space to cabin remains on the far end (4.75 miles : 11,095'), where it begins a steep and shifting descent down the north wall of Hell Canyon. It loses clarity in places, which can be exacerbated by snow. Views of Crawford Lake and Long Lake briefly emerge in Hell Canyon before losing sight amid rugged terrain. The trail gradually levels into a meadow in the upper valley, again vague in places but now with a clear heading (5.5 miles : 10,595'). It dips across before rising gently back in a thin forest to the north side of Stone Lake (6.15 miles : 10,643'). The lake opens to grassy shorelines, rocky outcrops and elevated terraces with great views and places to camp. Rock jetties extend far into the lake, offering unique access for anglers. The trail fades but easily follows the inlet stream through treeline to Upper Stone Lake (6.55 miles : 10,736'). Upper Stone Lake is surrounded by large, level meadows and a few tree-topped knolls. Hiamovi Mountain's distinct summit looms above, with an easily reached saddle near the Rocky Mountain National Park boundary. A more challenging pass to the SE can be scaled to access Cooper Peak and Island Lake on the far side. ROUNDTRIP ELEVATION PROFILE | TRAIL MAP",134.233333333

This short trail drops northwest from the Continental Divide through open tundra and skirts Pumphouse Lake en route to Corona Lake. Visitors will enjoy mild grades and excellent fishing against a high alpine backdrop: The trail begins on Rollins Pass Road with a good look at Deadman Lake (11,281'), James Peak (13,294') and the Winter Park Ski Area. It drops through open tundra and threads dense willow mats to the open north end of Pumphouse Lake (.4 miles : 11,384'). Pumphouse Lake is flanked by Mt Epworth (11,843'), and together with Corona Lake, forms the headwaters of Ranch Creek. The trail continues down to stream crossings at .67 miles and .73 miles, which at both points can be obscured by heavy runoff and overgrowth. Stay vigilant, and be sure not to veer (left) down-valley on an unmaintained trail beside Ranch Creek. The main trail edges north to its low point (.9 miles : 11,110'), then rises to a crest and drops back to Corona Lake (1.05 miles : 11,206'). Corona Lake is hemmed in by steep walls of the Continental Divide to the west, but its south and west shores are fairly open and easy to explore.",155.05
180,Sourdough Trail to Brainard Lake Recreation Area,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,11.6,9255,10075,820,3,True,"The Sourdough Trail stretches nearly 13 miles (south-north) from Rainbow Lakes Road to Camp Dick in the Roosevelt National Forest. This versatile trail runs along the eastern slopes of the Indian Peaks Wilderness, with mild grades ideal for runners, mountain bikers, and skiers.  The following describes the 5.3 mile section from Rainbow Lakes Road to the Red Rock Parking Area on Brainard Lake Road: The trail heads north in a lodgepole forest until bending west (.75 miles) up the east flank of Niwot Mountain (11,471'). Note the introduction of spruce and fir as you gain elevation and cross from the upper-montane to subalpine zone. These dense pine forests support deer, elk, bear, mountain lion and moose. The trail crosses Peace Memorial Bridge (2.5 miles : 9,924') over Four Mile Creek and switchbacks twice before resuming a steady pace and northerly heading. The forest opens momentarily (4.0 miles : 10,282') with panoramas of the Peak-to-Peak Highway corridor, undulating with a net elevation loss to the Little Raven Ski Trail split (5.35 miles : 10,068'). Travel moderates over Left Hand Creek (5.7 miles : 10,071') to the Red Rock parking area on Brainard Lake Road (5.8 miles : 10,075'). Those with time may consider a short walk to Red Rock Lake, a popular fishing and camping destination.",74.35

It stands just east of the Continental Divide with rangy views across the Middle St Vrain Creek drainage and Wild Basin Area of RMNP. The trail scales a steep gulch to treeline, then moderates across broad tundra saddles and ridges to the base of the summit, where an access route splits off and climbs 800' in just .8 miles to the top: The trail climbs steadily up the valley's north side through lodgepole and aspen to the Indian Peaks Wilderness Boundary (.7 miles : 9,332'), and a swath of diminutive, sparsely plotted limber pine (1.0 miles : 9,650'). The trail switchbacks hard left (west) one final time (1.5 miles : 10,008') before turning sharply south across the valley with perspective on the route you've taken to this point (1.75 miles : 10,215'). Grades briefly moderate at 2.1 miles (10,405'), then steepen back up the south valley wall. The trail twists steeply through uniformly tall spruce (a counter-intuitive contrast to the forest below), turning sharply south one last time before clearing treeline (2.65 miles : 10,765'). Travel eases along a broad tundra saddle between the triangulated shoulders of Meadow Mountain (11,632'), an unnamed peak, and St Vrain Mountain. It reaches the Rocky Mountain National Park Boundary (3.15 miles : 11,180') and levels for nearly half a mile on a south heading with some of the route's best views. This airy section overlooks Rocky Mountain's Wild Basin Area, Mount Copeland (13,176'), Ouzel Peak (12, 12,716'), Mahana Peak (12,632'), Longs Peak (14,259') and Mt Meeker (13,911'). Those not aiming for the summit will be content with views along this stretch. The trail exits Rocky Mountain National Park (3.6 miles : 11,335') and threads a few pockets of krummholz to an unmarked turnoff for St Vrain Mountain. A trio of unassuming cairns are all that initially guide you off the main trail toward the summit; remain vigilant and anticipate this point - more navigational help awaits up-slope. Leave the main trail (3.65 miles : 11,360') and aim for a band of krummholz approximately 200 yards away. Once through look for cairns and, most importantly, Indian Peaks - Rocky Mountain National Park Boundary posts to your right (north). St Vrain Mountain's unmaintained summit route hugs the IPW side of the boundary posts, and generally favors the most accommodating terrain. Still, anticipate rugged talus, steep grades, and snowfields year-round on the strenuous .75 mile summit push. St Vrain Mountain (4.45 miles : 12,162') is rounded with 2 wind shelters and unabated views. Continue along its west ridge to the Elk Tooth formation and base of Ogallala Peak (13,138') on the Divide.",92.7833333333

The following description travels clockwise. Distances include all destinations, and may vary slightly by route: The trail rises over Bear Lake through young aspen to the Odessa Lake - Mill Creek Basin split (.45 miles : 9,725') and veers left toward Odessa Lake to begin clockwise travel on the loop. It climbs steadily to the Flattop Mountain Trail split (1.0 mile : 9,965'), past which grades steepen in a thick pine forest. The trail pushes steeply to the Sourdough Campsite spur (2.65 miles : 10,585') and eases near treeline in the upper valley. The trail crests and dips to the first of several unmarked spurs (3.0 miles : 10,610') that thread patchy krummholz to the north shore of Lake Helene (3.1 miles : 10,580'). Lake Helene fills a shallow bench on the east slope of Flattop Mountain (12,324'), Ptarmigan Point (12,363') and Notchtop Mountain (12,129'). Retrace your steps to the main trail, which makes a sharp hairpin turn (north) around and down the west flank of Joe Mills Mountain. Knobtop Mountain (12,331') and Little Matterhorn (11,586') come into view as the trail runs across open talus sto the Odessa Lake access spur (4.1 miles : 10,035'). Bear left and follow the outlet stream to Odessa Lake (4.25 miles : 10,055'). Odessa Lake's east shore is cluttered, but those with time can find social trails leading to more open areas. Return to the main trail (4.4 miles) and resume a fast, nondescript descent to the east shore of Fern Lake (5.2 miles : 9,545'). Anglers will enjoy Fern Lake's plentiful greenback cutthroat trout, and over-nighters one of its 5 deep-wood campsites. The trail bends NE past Fern Lake and down steep, winding switchbacks to The Pool - Cub Lake Trail junction (7.25 miles). Note the introduction of aspen, oak, maple and alder in these lower riparian woodlands. Bear SE on The Pool-Cub Lake Trail toward Mill Creek Basin, which continues through a diverse forest to the Cub Lake access spur - Mill Creek Trail junction (8.15 miles : 8,710'). Cub Lake lake is visible from this point, and a few steps downhill lead to its aspen and berry-ringed shore (8.35 miles : 8,624'). Return to the junction and turn south on what is now the Mill Creek Trail. Here the nearly 5 mile, 2000' leisurely descent ends and the route's most demanding climb begins up the south wall over Cub Lake. The Mill Creek Trail climbs 750' in just .8 miles, crests and drops to a level clearing on the north side of Mill Creek Basin and the 1st of two spurs for Hollowell Park (9.95 miles : 9,010'). The trail skirts aspen-lined meadows and hops Mill Creek to the 2nd Hollowell Park spur and Mill Creek Basin backcountry campsite (10.2 miles : 9,005'). After this brief respite a methodical climb resumes to the Upper Mill Creek Basin backcountry campsite (10.4 miles : 9,125'). Follows signs for Bear Lake. The grade steepens a final time to the first of two spurs for Bierstadt Lake (10.85 miles : 9,395') and moderates under a thick canopy to the second (11.35 miles : 9,605'). Look for deer, elk, bear, grouse, fox, coyote and hare in this quiet, richly appointed spruce-fir forest. Travel eases to the Odessa Lake - Mill Creek Basin Trail junction (12.05 miles : 9,725') to complete the loop. Follow signs back to Bear Lake and the Bear Lake Trailhead (12.5 miles : 9,475').",119.1

The Bear Lake Nature Loop is an ideal family destination for its accessibility, short length, and ecological diversity. The loop trail begins just beyond the Bear Lake Ranger Station and should be hiked counter-clockwise to coincide with an interpretive guide available at the trailhead for a dollar or so. The interpretive guide is the key to 30 marked spots along the trail which tell the story of the Bear Lake Area. How is a glacier formed? What is that huge snow-capped peak to the east? When was this land last inhabited and by whom? Do black bears live at Bear Lake? The interpretive guide answers these questions and many more. It is highly recommended to purchase this brochure to enhance your experience while at Bear Lake.  The trail itself simply encircles Bear Lake, a beautiful body of water which rests in a rock basin in the middle of a healthy pine, fir and spruce forest. Take time to relax on one of several wood benches, enjoy the view and allow about one hour to complete the loop.",119.1

The summit could more aptly be described as a long saddle on the Continental Divide between Hallet Peak and Ptarmigan Point. A strenuous climb on well-kept trails leads through diverse forests and open tundra to the summit, with exceptional views and good wildlife viewing throughout:  The trail rises quickly over Bear Lake through young aspen to the Odessa Lake - Mill Creek Basin Trail split (.45 miles : 9,725'). It climbs steadily in a spruce-fir forest to the Flattop Mountain Trail (1.0 mile : 9,965'), which steepens considerably on a rough, winding path. Thick timber breaks at Dream Lake Overlook with good views up Glacier Gorge, and of Keyboard of the Winds on Longs Peak's west ridge (1.6 miles : 10,470'). Steady, steep climbing resumes in a thinning forest to Emerald Lake Overlook (2.9 miles : 11,357') with a revealing look over the valley carved by Tyndall Glacier, one of five active glaciers in the Park. Grades moderate as you transition through treeline (2.5 - 3.0 miles : 11,440'), where the forest is gradually reduced to thin bands of willow and krummholz. Krummholz - a German word meaning twisted wood - describes the stunted, irregular growth patterns of trees in the ecological transition zone between subalpine forests and alpine tundra. Poor soil, thin air, strong winds, and extreme weather limit growth at these elevations. Still, the tundra's grasses, lichens, and wildflowers support marmot, pika, ptarmigan, elk, bighorn sheep and mountain goat. Grades steady on a well-defined path into open tundra. Tread carefully over snowfields, and use cairns for guidance. The trail reaches a hitchrack (3.9 miles, 12,135') with a close look at Hallett Peak (12,713') across the Tyndall Glacier gorge. The trail scales a perennial snowfield over the hitchrack and levels on the final run up to Flattop Mountain (4.3 miles : 12,324'). No sign marks the summit, however the Flattop Mountain Trail - Tonahutu Trail junction is generally recognized as your final destination. This expansive flat along the Divide offers a rare opportunity to explore the tundra with relative ease.

Steady, steep climbing resumes in a thinning forest to Emerald Lake Overlook, which provides a commanding view over the gorge carved by Tyndall Glacier, one of five active glaciers in the Park (2.9 miles : 11,357'). Grades moderate as you transition through treeline (2.5 - 3.0 miles : 11,440'), where the forest gives way to thin bands of krummholz, willow, and forbs in the alpine tundra ecosystem. Most alpine plants are perennials, some are dwarfed, but their blossoms may be full-sized. Flowering plants often have dense hairs on stems and leaves for wind protection, or pigments capable of converting sunlight into heat. Cushion plants avoid wind by growing close to the ground, and anchor themselves with long taproots. Grasses and sedges take hold in richer soil beds. Non-flowering lichens can photosynthesize above 32 degrees, and outer fungal layers can absorb more than their own weight in water. Grades steady on a well-cut, cairn-marked path into open tundra. The trail passes a hitchrack (3.9 miles, 12,135') with an up-close look at Tyndall Glacier and Hallett Peak. The trail scales a perennial snowfield over the hitchrack and levels up to Flattop Mountain (4.3 miles : 12,324'), more aptly described as a long, level saddle on the Divide. No sign marks Flattop, but the Flattop - Tonahutu Trail split is generally recognized as the summit. Turn south to reach Hallett Peak. Even when clear of snow the route is frequently indistinguishable from the landscape; it may take a moment for your eyes to adjust and pick out the cairn-marked path. The rocky trail edges around the top of Tyndall Glacier (4.55 miles : 12,318'), a useful landmark and beginning of the turn up to Hallett Peak. Cairns mark the way, but blend seamlessly into the talus.

Knobtop Mountain (12,331'), Little Matterhorn (11,586') and the deep valley below come into view as the trail runs down a rugged talus slope to the Odessa Lake access spur (4.0 miles : 10,035'). Follow signs left across the outlet stream to Odessa Lake (4.15 miles : 10,055'). Odessa Lake's east shore is cluttered, but those with time can find social trails leading to more open space on the west shore. Be mindful of changing weather and remember that you must climb 637' back through treeline on the return hike to Bear Lake.",119.1
190,Otis Peak,rocky-mountain-national-park,12.0,9475,12486,3011,5,False,"Otis Peak (12,486') caps an arete along the Continental Divide between Chaos Canyon (north), and Andrews Glacier (south). No maintained trail reaches Otis Peak, however a well-established route continues south from Flattop Mountain across open tundra to the summit.  Visitors will enjoy exceptional views and insight to the Park's complex glacial formation: The trail rises quickly over Bear Lake through young aspen to the Odessa Lake - Mill Creek Basin Trail split (.45 miles : 9,725'). It climbs steadily in a spruce-fir forest to the Flattop Mountain Trail (1.0 mile : 9,965'), which steepens considerably on a rough, winding path. Thick timber breaks at Dream Lake Overlook with good views up Glacier Gorge, and of Keyboard of the Winds on Longs Peak's west ridge (1.6 miles : 10,470'). Steady, steep climbing resumes in a thinning forest to Emerald Lake Overlook, which provides a commanding view over the gorge carved by Tyndall Glacier, one of five active glaciers in the Park (2.9 miles : 11,357'). Grades moderate as you transition through treeline (2.5 - 3.0 miles : 11,440'), where the once towering forest is reduced to thin bands of krummholz. Krummholz - a German word meaning twisted wood - describes the stunted, irregular growth patterns of trees in the ecological transition zone between subalpine forests and alpine tundra. Poor soil, thin air, strong winds, and extreme weather limit and deform growth at these elevations. Grades steady on a well-defined path into the open tundra. Tread carefully over snowfields, and use cairns for guidance. The trail passes a hitchrack (3.9 miles, 12,135') with a good look at Tyndall Glacier and Hallett Peak (12,713'). The trail scales a perennial snowfield over the hitchrack and levels up to Flattop Mountain (4.3 miles : 12,324'), which is more aptly described as a broad flat along the Divide. No sign marks the summit, however the Flattop Mountain Trail - Tonahutu Trail junction is generally recognized as the summit. To reach Otis Peak, turn south and follow the faint path toward Hallett Peak. While this will add some additional climbing, it's the most direct route, and preferable to damaging sensitive tundra grasses on improvised routes. The rocky path edges around the top of Tyndall Glacier (4.5 miles : 12,318'), a useful landmark and beginning of the turn up to Hallett Peak. Continue on as if you were to summit Hallet, but break south and continue toward Otis at 4.7 miles (12,475'). Here you'll drop to a long saddle between Hallett and Otis Peak with a terrific look down Chaos Canyon (5.5 miles : 12,096'). Glass the open tundra for herds of elk and bighorn sheep, which are fairly common during summer months. Follow the saddle up, and scramble across the arete (6.3 miles : 12,287') to the summit of Otis Peak (6.0 miles : 12,486'). Views from the summit include Taylor Peak (13,153'), Longs Peak (14,259'), Notchtop Mountain (12,129'), Ptarmigan Point (12,363'), Andrews Peak (12,565'), and portions of the Mummy Range, Never Summer Range and Grand Lake area. Andrews Tarn lies just below Andrews Glacier, but it's difficult to see without potentially hazardous maneuvering.",119.1
191,Bierstadt Lake,rocky-mountain-national-park,3.2,8862,9416,554,2,False,"Rocky Mountain National Park's landscape has been shaped by the cyclical growth, recession and reconstitution of glaciers over many millennia. Glacial movement grinds the land beneath it, depositing till on its margins that accumulate on ridges called moraines. Bierstadt Lake fills a shallow depression in a lateral moraine north of Bear Lake Road. A moderately steep climb on well-crafted switchbacks pass through open hillsides to a heavily wooded moraine-top and Bierstadt Lake. A one mile loop continues around the lake with numerous access points and post-card panoramas of the Continental Divide. The Bierstadt Lake Trail is well-suited for families, runners, and winter recreation: The trail climbs methodically on long-leg switchbacks through open hillsides of sage, grasses, and wildflowers. Aspen line portions of the trail, with much thicker stands on its fringes. Rangy views extend from Longs Peak (south) to Thatchtop Mountain (north) before leveling off in a thick lodgepole forest (.97 miles : 9,451'). Here it drops gently to the Bierstadt Lake Loop Trail junctionon the lake's southwest corner (1.05 miles : 9,438'), which continues for one mile around the lake basin through lodgepole, spruce, and fir. This upper-montane forest is arguably the Park's most biologically diverse, a food-rich ecosystem that attracts deer, elk, bear, fox, snowshoe hare among many others. Travel around Bierstadt Lake is mild and well-maintained, with numerous marked and unmarked spurs leading to its damp, sedge-lined shore. The lake's east end provides the most complete look at the Continental Divide, with standouts such as Otis Peak (12,486'), Hallet Peak (12,713'), Flattop Mountain (12,324'), Ptarmigan Point (12,363') and Notchtop Mountain (12,129'). Connections to Bear Lake, Mill Creek Basin, Cub Lake, and Sprague Lake extend travel through the east-central quadrant of the Park.",112.116666667
192,Parika Lake,rocky-mountain-national-park,10.1,8864,11360,2496,4,False,"Parika Lake is located just west of Rocky Mountain National Park in the Never Summer Wilderness Area. The Bowen-Baker Trailhead is located within the Park, but the trail to Parika Lake quickly crosses the boundary.  Despite its inhospitable name, the Never Summer Wilderness features exceptional bio-diversity and some of the best alpine scenery accessible within or from Rocky Mountain National Park. Visitors will enjoy light crowds and wildlife viewing that includes elk, moose, bighorn sheep, and mountain goat: The trail begins on a mild grade in a densely wooded forest that opens and diversifies after one mile. It steadies through pleasant but unspectacular scenery to the Grand Ditch service road at about 3.25 miles, veers left, and levels on the north side of a pretty meadow framed by peaks to the southwest. The trail reaches the Baker Gulch Trail split (3.55 miles) and begins a moderately strenuous climb into a mature spruce-fir forest. Damp clearings are a good place to find elk, moose, and abundant wildflowers. Anticipate two stream crossings that may be tricky with heavy runoff or large packs.  The trail passes a large pond at 4.25 miles (about 75 yards off the trail's right), a worthwhile detour if time permits. Grades moderate in open tundra on the final approach to Parika Lake (5.05 miles : 11,360').  Parika Lake fills a grassy alpine flat just below Parika Peak (12,394'), Fairview Mountain (12,246') and an unnamed peak (12,253'). A well-maintained social trail circles the lake's south shore and leads to Parika Peak. Look for mountain goat and bighorn sheep on rocky slopes above the lake.",209.333333333
193,Chapin Creek Trail,rocky-mountain-national-park,6.6,11040,10205,-835,3,False,"The Chapin Creek Trail offers a unique backcountry experience through a biologically rich and lightly used corner of Rocky Mountain National Park. It drops from Fall River Road to the Chapin Creek Valley, where cross-country travel leads through expansive meadows to the Cache La Poudre River confluence.  These damp meadows below Mount Chapin and Marmot Point support abundant wildlife, particularly concentrations of elk and moose. While the route is intuitively followed, there's virtually no trail once in the valley. Hikers will get wet traipsing boggy areas with animal tracks providing the best / only guidance. Basic route finding is necessary, especially on the return to regain the maintained trail. Visitors will enjoy diverse terrain, open travel and great wildlife viewing on the Chapin Creek Trail: The trail climbs steeply to the Chapin Creek - Mummy Range Peaks split (.12 miles : 11,175'), where it drops in a thick forest with occasional deadfall. Steep intervals moderate to the meadow's edge and a sign for the start of x-country travel (.8 miles : 10,588'). Note this important point, which is concealed by timber and hard to see on the return. Continue down the meadow and remain west of the creek, preferable for morning sun and drier slopes. Use elk and moose tracks for efficient passage through dense willow and brush. The trail rises over a narrow section in the valley (1.4 miles : 10,470') and drops to a wide, intermittently drier section (2.1 miles : 10,315'). Look for moose, elk, bear and even mountain lion in this open area. You'll cross a tributary en route to the Chapin Creek Campsite sign (2.65 miles : 10,243'), which may be off your immediate heading but visible from a distance. Cross Chapin Creek (2.7 miles : 10,235') onto a clear path over dry, rolling hills that seamlessly merge with the Poudre River Valley. Once again, take note of your surroundings. There are several 'finger' valleys that seem to head back up to Fall River Road from this low point, but only one accesses the maintained trail. A good path leads to a dilapidated bridge over the Poudre River (3.2 miles), which is more safely crossed in the water. It rises past dispersed camping boundary signs to the faint Poudre River Trail on the west side of the valley (3.3 miles : 10,165'). The Cache La Poudre River Trail is a similar cross-country route that runs 9.2 miles from Poudre Lake / Milner Pass to the Mummy Pass Trail in the northwest corner of the Park.",134.433333333
194,Mount Chiquita and Ypsilon Mountain,rocky-mountain-national-park,8.1,11040,13514,2474,4,False,"Mount Chiquita (13,069') and Ypsilon Mountain (13,514') are accessible from Chapin Pass Trailhead on Fall River Road in Rocky Mountain National Park. No trail leads to these prominent summits in the Mummy Range, but a well-established route follows contour lines and saddles to each. Mount Chiquita is considered among the easiest 13ers in the Park, and Ypsilon requires a bit more effort at higher elevation. Their distinct east faces drop vertically and form the headwalls of massive cirques, while the west sides are relatively moderate, grassy slopes up which the route runs. Views are exceptional throughout, with western panoramas that extend from the Never Summer Range to the Medicine Bow peaks in Wyoming. Views north and east include the Desolation Peaks, Longs Peak complex and aptly named Spectacle Lakes. Mt Chapin, Chiquita and Ypsilon form the venerable CCY route. Mt Chapin (12,454') is excluded here for expediency in reaching the more distant peaks, and is arguably superfluous given its diminutive stature and proximity to Chiquita and Ypsilon. Though well-traveled, the route is vague in places and basic navigation skills are required across rugged alpine terrain. Anticipate full exposure at high altitudes, and get an early start to avoid afternoon storms: The trail climbs quickly to the split for Chapin Creek and all summits (.12 miles : 11,175'). It rises steeply in a thinning forest to unmarked Chapin Pass (.5 miles : 11,407'), then moderates to a fork and sign for All Summits (.65 miles : 11,472'). Go right. The left fork is a compelling alternative that dips across lower slopes (bypassing Mt Chapin) before rising steeply to the Chapin - Chiquita saddle. Some prefer this approach for milder terrain, but it does delay the inevitable climb, and adds more to the overall gain. The right fork edges moderately up contour lines with long views down the Chapin Creek valley. It clears treeline (1.0 mile : 11,752') and begins rugged talus intervals at 1.3 miles. A variously clear path moves steadily to the Chapin - Chiquita saddle (1.75 miles : 12,114'). The Mt Chapin summit - right above you on this stretch - is accessible via several spurs. Travel eases momentarily on the saddle before pitching up the south flank of Chiquita. Grass gradually yields to talus, where the route braids into several viable cairn-marked paths. The way is obvious even if the trail is not. You'll see rock wind shelters around 2.6 miles leading up to the Mount Chiquita summit (2.7 miles : 13,069'). To reach Ypsilon Mountain, follow the most established track 200' down to the Chiquita - Ypsilon saddle (3.0 miles : 12,812'). A variously clear path climbs steadily up Ypsilon's south flank to a reprieve with exceptional views down couloirs to the Spectacle Lakes (3.85 miles : 13,360'). The couloirs form a distinct Y down the east face for which the mountain is named (Ypsilon is the Greek letter Y). A short, final push leads to the Ypsilon Mountain summit (4.05 miles : 13,514'). Though tempting to circumvent Chiquita on the return, consider retracing your steps back to the summit. Having some trail is more efficient than none at all in this terrain, and backtracking will limit your impact on delicate vegetation.",134.433333333
195,Mirror Lake (Rocky Mountain National Park),rocky-mountain-national-park,12.2,10070,11015,945,3,False,"Mirror Lake is located 6.1 miles from the Corral Creek Trailhead in the lightly traveled northwest corner of Rocky Mountain National Park. It lies near treeline in an isolated, steep-walled N-S valley in the Mummy Range. Visitors will enjoy large open valleys, pristine forests, abundant wildlife, and miles of remote wilderness travel on the hike to Mirror Lake:  The trail begins on a flat dirt road that soon becomes trail along a lively section of Corral Creek. It passes uneventfully through a lodgepole forest, enters Rocky Mountain National Park (1.3 miles), and breaks south into a massive valley carved by the Cache LaPoudre River.  It parallels the river for .5 miles to the Mummy Pass Trail split. Immediately south is a vast meadow fed by Hague Creek - consider detouring through this wildlife-rich area on a .7 mile long spur used to access the Hague Creek, Desolation and Flatiron backcountry campsites.  The Mummy Pass Trail climbs steadily for .75 miles in a spruce-fir forest accented by fallen timber and thick ground cover. It moderates for .5 miles, then pushes once more up a forested ridge to the Mirror Lake Trail split (4.3 miles : 10,700'). Turn north (left) towards Mirror Lake. The Mirror Lake Trail undulates .75 miles in a thinning subalpine forest to a meadow beside Cascade Creek. It climbs past the north edge of the meadow to the Comanche Peak Trail split where you'll see a voluminous cascade two hundred yards shy of the lake.  The final quarter mile is highlighted by open rocky areas and abundant wildflowers. Mirror Lake (6.1 miles : 11,015') is tightly ringed by several towering, unnamed peaks. The lake shore is somewhat cluttered, but easy enough to reach several good spots for fishing its healthy brown trout population. You can follow an unmaintained route up the lake's east shore and inlet stream to a small pond just north of Mirror Lake. Marked spur trails lead to several backcountry campsites in the lake vicinity.",189.466666667
196,Bridal Veil Falls,rocky-mountain-national-park,6.1,7855,8775,920,3,False,"Bridal Veil Falls is located 3.05 miles from the Cow Creek Trailhead on the east side of Rocky Mountain National Park. The hike closely follows Cow Creek through ponderosa parks and aspen-fir forests to the 20' cascade. This 3-4 season trail features mild grades, abundant wildlife and views of Lumpy Ridge - a prominent granite rock complex home to numerous raptor species and world class climbing. The Bridal Veil Falls Trail is especially attractive in the fall when aspen and leafy riparian corridors yield brilliant colors. Early risers will enjoy favorable light and a good chance of seeing deer, elk, turkey, coyote, and fox: The Cow Creek Trail heads west on a gravel road through the McGraw Ranch Research Facility into a large meadow fed by Cow Creek. It moves quickly through open space before narrowing on single track, rising incrementally toward the creek (.65 miles : 7,938'). Well-spaced aspen and ponderosa provide good wildlife viewing lanes through much of the lower valley. The trail passes through intervals of meadow and sparse timber to the Gem Lake Trail split (1.15 miles : 8,095') and Rabbit Ears Backcountry Campsite spur (1.35 miles : 8,089'). You'll reach the Bridal Veil Falls - Dark Mountain Trail split in the center of another large meadow and veer right (1.95 miles : 8,236'). The grade steepens - albeit modestly - into a busy mix of ponderosa, aspen, fir, and spruce before moderating on a damp path beside the creek. It crosses the creek twice (2.6 miles and 2.85 miles) and continues up a confining ravine to a hitchrack, past which horses are not permitted (2.9 miles : 8,614'). The trail is rugged and occasionally ill-defined as it climbs rocks slabs and stone stairs to the base of Bridal Veil Falls (3.05 miles : 8,775'). Uneven terrain, limited space, and powerful currents may initially limit views, but creative maneuvering should help find a desirable vantage (much of the year you can expect to get a bit wet). The top of Bridal Veil Falls is accessible from a social trail up its south side, where you'll find a set of smooth running cascades, interesting rock formations and terrific views of this isolated vicinity.",100.066666667
197,North Boundary Trail,rocky-mountain-national-park,12.1,7855,9272,1417,5,False,"The North Boundary Trail stretches 6.1 miles from the Cow Creek Trailhead in the northeast corner of Rocky Mountain National Park to the North Fork Trail intersection along the North Fork Big Thompson River. This strenuous, lightly used trail climbs three major hills and crosses several major drainages en route. Visitors will enjoy solitude, abundant wildlife and 3-season accessibility:  Head west on Cow Creek Trail through McGraw Ranch to the North Boundary Trail split (.15 miles : 7,875'). The North Boundary Trail rises steadily through a ponderosa park, joining aspen and spruce as you progress. Well-spaced trees provide good viewing lanes for active wildlife in this area. Travel steepens considerably through a confining gulch topped by large granite promontories to a divisive ridge between the Cow Creek and West Creek drainages (.78 miles : 8,457'). Take in rangy N-S views before descending steep, tightly wound switchbacks that moderate near the valley floor (1.25 miles). Note contrastingly thick lodgepole and fir on this north-facing slope. The trail crosses West Creek (1.45 miles : 7,905') and follows it to the West Creek Falls Trail split (1.65 miles : 7,953'). Here it bends north and rises away from the creek, leveling briefly through an open rocky area with northwesterly views of the Mummy Range (2.0 miles : 8,347'). The trail rounds a second major hilltop (2.45 miles : 8,595') and drops across a small tributary and Fox Creek in quick succession (2.75 miles : 8,459'). The North Boundary Trail turns uphill and begins its third and most challenging climb, gaining nearly 1,300' in just 1.5 miles through uniform lodgepole. It reaches a thin ridge - the trail's highest point (4.25 miles : 9,735') - and levels with commanding views of the valley below. The trail drops gradually through mixed pine and crosses an unnamed creek to the Silvanmere Backcountry Campsite (5.6 miles : 9,360'), past which it eases to the North Fork of Big Thompson River and its terminus at the North Fork Trail junction (6.1 miles : 9,272').",100.066666667
198,West Creek Falls,rocky-mountain-national-park,4.75,7855,8158,303,3,False,"The West Creek Falls are located along on a short spur off the North Boundary Trail in the northeast section of Rocky Mountain National Park. The falls pour through tiered granite chutes into sizable pools along West Creek. West Creek Falls offer a comparable aesthetic to nearby Bridal Veil Falls, but lead deeper into the backcountry with lighter crowds.  Visitors will enjoy diverse forests, good wildlife viewing, and fishing along West Creek: Head west on Cow Creek Trail through McGraw Ranch to the North Boundary Trail split (.15 miles : 7,875'). The North Boundary Trail turns north and rises steadily through a ponderosa park, joining aspen and spruce as you progress. Well-spaced trees provide good viewing lanes for deer, elk and coyote that frequent this area. Travel steepens up a tapered gulch topped by large granite promontories to a divisive ridge between the Cow Creek and West Creek drainages at the trail's highest point (.78 miles : 8,457'). Take in good N-S views before diving down steep, tightly wound switchbacks that moderate near the valley floor (1.25 miles). Note contrastingly thick lodgepole and fir on this north-facing slope. The trail crosses West Creek (1.45 miles : 7,905'), then turns left beside it at a trail sign. The North Boundary Trail moderates through ponderosa stands to the West Creek Falls Trail split (1.65 miles : 7,953'). The West Creek Falls Trail eases along luxuriant banks, edges away through grassy slopes, then back to the creek. It re-enters Rocky Mountain National Park at 2.0 miles (8,055'), where anglers need honor greenback cutthroat trout regulations. The trail undulates up-stream to a pool at the base of West Creek Falls (2.37 miles : 8,158'). A rugged social trail climbs to a second pool and larger, more energetic fall. Keep a safe distance, as rocks lining the chute can be very slick and there is little room for error, especially during the runoff.",100.066666667
199,Cub Lake,rocky-mountain-national-park,4.6,8121,8624,503,2,False,"Cub Lake is a family-friendly, 3-4 season destination highlighted by the Big Thompson River, large elk herds in Moraine Park and vibrant autumn colors:  The trail heads south over Big Thompson River and undulates gently along the western fringe of Moraine Park, a vast meadow where glaciers once settled and receded, leaving a broad, level expanse in its place. Bordering ridges - called moraines - were formed by glacial movements that push churned land to its margins. Today Moraine Park is braided by the Big Thompson River and Cub Creek, which give rise to bountiful grasses teeming with life. Every fall large elk herds congregate in these food-rich meadows for their annual rut, a spectacular ritual where dominant bulls battle for mating rights. Mule deer gather in smaller numbers and are common throughout the year. Smaller residents such as squirrels, voles, rabbit and hare attract larger predators such as coyote, fox, bobcat and raptors, while bears seek out autumn berries along meadows and streams for their long winter hibernation. The trail reaches an unmarked split for South Lateral Moraine Trail and bends decisively west up valley (.55 miles : 8,095'). Small-medium sized ponds and thick grass beds dot the valley floor, ideal habitat for seeing elk. Well-spaced ponderosa, spruce, aspen and fir create good wildlife viewing lanes across the lower valley. The trail moves quickly on a mild grade that steepens past 1.75 miles (8,285') and enters a thick aspen grove. Enjoy this colorful section from the trail, as the stream-laced forest floor is covered in ivy. The winding trail relaxes on the edge of a marsh at the Cub Creek Backcountry Campsite spur (2.2 miles : 8,603'), and continues west to the northeast corner of Cub Lake (2.3 miles : 8,624'). Cub Lake is ringed by thick timber, limiting access and extensive exploration. Its east shore and outlet area are open but marshy. A social trail drops down to and traces the lake's north shore, while the main trail rises over the lake for .3 miles to the Mill Creek Trail junction (2.6 miles : 8,725'). Consider hiking to this point for additional perspective and better afternoon lighting. Those seeking a longer outing may continue on to The Pool, Fern Lake or Mill Creek Basin. The Pool - a turbulent pocket below the convergence of Fern Creek, Spruce Creek and Big Thompson - is one mile from this point, and Fern Creek a more challenging 2.1 mile climb. A loop around Moraine Park can be made via the South Lateral Moraine Trail on the return.",106.266666667
200,Beaver Mountain Loop via Deer Ridge Junction,rocky-mountain-national-park,7.15,8930,8930,287,3,False,"Beaver Mountain (10,491') is located in the east central quadrant of Rocky Mountain National Park. A series of connector trails join the Beaver Mountain Trail to form a lollipop loop through meadows, ponderosa parks, and aspen-fir forests in the heart of Rocky Mountain's montane zone, perhaps the most diverse ecosystem in the Park.  A high water table under Beaver Meadows creates fine, moist soil conditions that do not effectively support tree growth. These meadow-creating conditions are perpetuated over time by grazing wildlife and natural fires. Surrounding slopes, where soil conditions improve, support ponderosa woodlands, aspen, fir and lodgepole pine. This rich mosaic of meadow and forest provides ideal habitat, safe passage, and abundant food for elk, deer, bear, mountain lion, badger, fox and coyote. The Beaver Mountain Loop is a versatile, 3-4 season route with magnificent views and excellent wildlife viewing opportunities throughout: The trail begins on the south side of Trail Ridge Road at the Deer Ridge Junction Trailhead. It drops quickly on unnamed but well-marked connector trails into Beaver Meadows. Follow signs right (.64 miles : 8,517') and left (1.0 miles : 8,532') toward the Upper Beaver Meadows Trailhead. Cross Upper Beaver Meadows Road (1.45 miles : 8,466') to reach Upper Beaver Meadows Trailhead and begin the loop (1.55 miles : 8,440'). The trail splits again just a few steps from the trailhead, forming a short loop within a loop. The forks are equidistant and rejoin at a sign for Trail Ridge Road - Ute Meadow Campsite (2.15 miles : 8,568'). Curiously, the Beaver Mountain Trail is not listed on these signs, but heading for Trail Ridge Road will keep you on track in each instance. The Beaver Mountain Trail leaves open meadow and climbs into a mixed pine-fir forest. It wraps around a large outcrop (2.85 miles), crosses a stream, and heads SW up a narrow gulch to the Ute Trail split (3.2 miles : 9,025'). The low rise to your left is the top of a divisive moraine between Moraine Park (south) and Beaver Meadows (north). Moraines are ridges of glacial till pushed aside by a glacier's downward movement. Take a few steps off trail for terrific views over Moraine Park and the Cub Creek drainage from the top of this unique geological feature. The Beaver Mountain Trail continues steadily up the east shoulder of Beaver Mountain. It crests on the route's highest point (3.75 miles : 9,217') and drops to a hitch rack (3.85 miles : 9,120'). The trail continues downhill through uniform lodgepole to a footbridge over Beaver Brook (4.7 miles : 8,715'). Once over it skirts an aspen studded meadow, one of many good places to find bear on this trail. The trail climbs back into a thinning forest, which transitions back to ponderosa park and meadow at a sign for Deer Ridge Junction (6.15 miles : 8,532'). This completes the loop. Retrace your steps - a one mile, 400' climb - back to Deer Ridge Junction (7.15 miles : 8,930').",103.9
201,Deer Mountain,rocky-mountain-national-park,6.0,8930,10013,1083,3,False,"Deer Mountain (10,013') caps a tall, divisive ridge between Beaver Meadows (south) and Horseshoe Park (northwest) in Rocky Mountain National Park. This moderate hike follows a well-maintained trail through ponderosa parks, aspen stands and subalpine forests to the summit, which rises just above all other points on the ridge. Southern exposure keeps the trail snow-free longer than many others in the Park, extending accessibility from late spring to early winter. Visitors will enjoy ecological diversity and panoramas that include some of Rocky Mountain's most iconic summits, meadows and geological features: The Deer Mountain Trail heads east on a steady grade across sparsely treed hillsides of ponderosa and aspen. Deer and elk are common along these lower slopes, and southern views over Longs Peak, Beaver Meadows and Moraine Park improve with each step. Moraines separating these meadows - or low ridges of glacial till pushed aside by a glacier's downward movement - gain definition as you progress. The trail switchbacks at .85 miles with views over Horseshoe Park and the Mummy Range including Mount Chapin (12,454'), Mount Chiquita (13,069'), Ypsilon Mountain (13,514') and Fairchild Mountain (13,502'). Switchbacks steepen through 1.55 miles (9,612') in a thicker mix of aspen, spruce, and fir before leveling abruptly on the ridge top (2.05 miles : 9,835'). Travel eases through 2.25 miles (9,930') before dipping and climbing back to the Deer Mountain Summit Trail split (2.8 miles : 9,843'). Bear right for a short but steep climb to the summit. The Deer Mountain summit (3.0 miles : 10,013') is small but easily maneuvered for sensational panoramas that stretch across Estes Park, Longs Peak and neighboring summits on the Continental Divide, Moraine Park, Beaver Meadows, Horseshoe Park and the Mummy Range. A good map will help identify all points of interest, and provide useful perspective on the greater landscape and distance between each feature.",103.9
202,Bulwark Ridge Trail to Signal Mountain,rocky-mountain-national-park,11.85,7817,11262,3445,5,True,"Signal Mountain is located in the Comanche Peak Wilderness Area, just outside the northeastern-most corner of Rocky Mountain National Park.  It stands over the Pennock Creek drainage with panoramas that include Mt Meeker (13,911'), Longs Peak (14,259'), South Signal Mountain (11,248') and various summits in the Stormy Peaks Range, Mummy Range, Never Summer Range and Comanche Peak Wilderness. This challenging trail sees light traffic and is often passable by mid June. Visitors will enjoy varied terrain and lengthy stretches of open tundra en route to the summit. Note: Though the Bulwark Trail and Signal Mountain are located in the Comanche Peak Wilderness, it's grouped here within Rocky Mountain National Park because it begins at the Dunraven Trailhead, which also accesses many destinations in the NE section of the Park: The Bulwark Ridge Trail begins at the north end of the Dunraven Trailhead. Follow the service road .35 miles to Trails End Ranch and signs pointing right to continue the trail. Here it begins a steep, twisting climb up a fire-scarred hillside with good views of the valley below. Fire-induced erosion has gullied out this challenging segment, leaving it susceptible to washouts and mud. The trail levels through a small meadow (.8 miles : 8,465') and enters an unaffected tract of pine, aspen and glades with good viewing lanes for wildlife. The trail moves quickly to the Miller Fork - Indian Trail junction and veers left into a thicker forest (1.3 miles : 8,717'). It rises gradually up Bulwark Ridge through uniform columns of lodgepole, becoming rocky and appreciably steeper as you progress (2.0 miles : 9,020'). Spruce and fir mark the transition from montane to subalpine ecosystems on this rapid climb (2.5 miles : 9,424'), an attractive composite of verdant ground cover, rocky outcrops and small clearings from blown-down trees. The trail climbs steeply with brief, flat intervals on the upper ridge between 3.5 and 4.5 miles. It crests in a thinning and shrinking forest atop Bulwark Ridge with navigationally useful views of the Signal Mountains (4.5 miles : 10,839'). It glides gently downhill and bends north up the east flank of South Signal Mountain, the path now intermittently faint and obscured by lingering snow. Large cairns provide guidance, but vigilance and a good topo map are still essential through treeline. Note pockets of limber pine here, a species well-adapted to high elevations and extreme conditions. The trail edges up the east flank of South Signal Mountain and breaks treeline along a wide saddle between South Signal Mountain and Signal Mountain (5.5 miles : 10,990'). Views are big, and the path is now intuitively followed through open tundra to either summit. The trail keeps north and climbs the saddle to Signal Mountain's east ridge. The main trail continues north and drops, but to reach the summit you'll break left (west) on this ridge for .1 miles to a rock wind shelter that officially marks Signal Mountain (5.92 miles : 11,262'). The summit area is long, flat and easily explored. Look down Signal Mountain's open north and west slopes for elk, moose, bighorn sheep and mountain goat. Consider summiting South Signal Mountain on the return, a relatively short, easily navigated excursion off the main trail. The Bulwark Ridge Trail continues north from Signal Mountain 5.8 miles to its terminus on Pingree Park Road.",111.016666667
203,North Fork Trail to Kettle Tarn,rocky-mountain-national-park,10.25,7807,9237,1430,3,True,"The North Fork Trail stretches 7.2 miles along the North Fork Big Thompson River from the Dunraven Trailhead in the Comanche Peak Wilderness Area to Lost Falls in Rocky Mountain National Park. Kettle Tarn fills a shallow depression in a bordering moraine 5.1 miles from the trailhead.  Hikers, runners and equestrians will enjoy miles of aspen-lined river banks, lengthy meadows, diverse forests, eleven backcountry campsites and renowned fishing along the North Fork Big Thompson en route to this interesting glacial feature. The trail begins from the south side of the Dunraven Trailhead parking lot and drops quickly to the North Fork Big Thompson River (.35 miles : 7,670'). It turns upstream on a mild grade along its open, luxuriant banks. Well-spaced trees and deadfall clearings provide good viewing lanes for wildlife - notably deer, elk, bear and turkey - in this first mile. The trail moves quickly to a second major bridge crossing (1.15 miles : 7,804'), passing for a short time through private property and a more crowded forest. It reaches a spur for backcountry campsite #1 (2.15 miles : 8,038') and crosses back on a sturdy bridge to the south bank. The North Fork Trail continues easily to a side trail for horses and spur for backcountry campsite #2 (2.75 miles : 8,170'), just past which it crosses the river once more to the edge of a sloping meadow and spur to backcountry campsite #3 (2.8 miles : 8,175'). The trail now relaxes between the river and string of meadows, ponderosa parks and aspen stands for the next .65 miles, in which the next six backcountry campsites are located. This section is well-suited for picnics, fishing and wildlife viewing, and is a good turnaround point for shorter outings. The trail passes backcountry campsite #9 (3.45 miles : 8,418') and inches up into a thicker forest. It turns abruptly north (3.6 miles : 8,482') and steepens on a markedly rockier path through uniform lodgepole before curling west and edging back toward the river. The North Fork Trail moderates through a notably diverse forest to the Rocky Mountain National Park Boundary (4.35 miles : 8,934'), past which no dogs are allowed and anglers and backpackers must be cognizant of applicable regulations (described below). A variously thin and diminutive forest offers a teasing glimpse of Mount Dickinson (11,831') and more distant peaks in the Mummy Range as it undulates to the Boundary Creek Backcountry Campsite (4.5 miles : 8,968'). The trail eases to the Kettle Tarn Backcountry Campsite spur (5.07 miles : 9,230'), which you'll follow over the river on an oft-slippery log bridge to the south bank. A faint but intuitively followed path crests a moraine and drops to the open shore of Kettle Tarn (5.12 miles : 9,240'). The tarn is adjacent to a similarly shallow pond, both ringed by a generous, sandy shoreline that's easily explored.",110.966666667

This notably large lake fills a slender, steep-walled basin midway up the East Inlet valley. The long but moderate trail features miles of cascading streams, abundant wildlife, a stop at Lone Pine Lake and 8 backcountry campsites: The trail passes splits for Adams Falls (.27 miles) and levels around the north side of East Meadow, an expansive meadow cut by slow moving oxbows on the East Inlet. This is a popular destination for anglers, and great place to see moose. The trail enters a thinned-out lodgepole forest to Lower East Inlet backcountry campsite (2.35 miles : 8,685'), where grades steepen on rugged terrain up the valley's north wall. It crests at 3.45 miles (9,220') and drops to the creek, where healthier fir trees appear and soften the aesthetic loss from pervasive beetle kill. The trail levels by a slow section of water before rising away to the Cats Lair backcountry campsite (3.8 miles : 9,210'). It edges back to the creek and undulates to a bridge over to the south side of East Inlet (4.35 miles : 9,405'), just past which are a series of powerful cascades. The trail steepens away on a rocky-rooted path to the Gray Jay Group campsite (5.05 miles : 9,805'), then crosses a debris field created by a recent avalanche. The NPS has done a great job making it passable, but expect fallen trees and vague spots on this short segment. Travel eases on the final aproach to Lone Pine Lake (5.4 miles : 9,885'). The trail turns sharply up Lone Pine's kinetic inlet falls to open rock slabs with aerial views of the lake, crossing back to the creek's north side on this scenic climb. Grades moderate between Slick Rock backcountry campsite (5.7 miles : 10,040') and Solitaire backcountry campsite (6.0 miles : 10,145') through a slot in the valley where the creek is dammed up into three large pools by logjams and talus. This interesting stretch continues to the Upper Inlet backcountry campsite (6.6 miles : 10,190'), then crests and drops to the NW shore of Lake Verna (6.9 miles : 10,200'), the Lake Verna backcountry campsite and beginning of unimproved travel. Lake Verna's long shoreline is rugged and cluttered by thick timber, but the unimproved trail and various social trails facilitate exploration. It's worth continuing a few hundred yards up the unimproved trail to appreciate the lake's scale, and reach its open NE shore. This unimproved portion of the East Inlet Trail continues on to Spirit Lake (7.9 miles : 10,290'), Fourth Lake (8.5 miles : 10,360'), Fifth Lake and Boulder Grand Pass, which leads to Thunder Lake in Wild Basin east of the Divide.

It edges back to the creek and undulates to a bridge over to the south side of East Inlet (4.35 miles : 9,405'), just past which are a series of powerful cascades. This is a good turnaround point if not aiming for the lakes. The trail steepens away from the creek on a rocky-rooted path to the Gray Jay Group campsite (5.05 miles : 9,805'), then crosses a debris field created by a recent avalanche. The NPS has done a great job making it passable, but expect fallen trees and vague spots on this short segment. Travel moderates on the final run to Lone Pine Lake (5.4 miles : 9,885'), with multiple access points to its open perimeter. Look for moose in the vicinity, which are drawn to the marshy basin's willow and aquatic plants. Continue a short distance past Lone Pine to see its kinetic inlet, and up switchbacks beside the falls to open rock slabs with terrific views over the lake. Social trails on Lone Pine's west shore have partial views up-valley of Andrews Peak (12,565'), Mt Alice (13,310'), Boulder Grand Pass (12,061'), Isolation Peak (13,118') and Mt Craig (12,007').",129.0

The unimproved trail is initially quite rugged and difficult to distinguish from social trails; when in doubt, err along the waterline - it's much easier than the steep, cluttered forest above. Proceed cautiously through intervals of deadfall, running water and slippery rocks. The terrain moderates and path clarifies considerably upon reaching the open east inlet of Lake Verna (7.5 miles). The trail rises nominally on a shifting path through drier bands of timber to the edge of Spirit Lake (7.9 miles : 10,298'). Spirit Lake is comparable in size to Lake Verna, but positioned better in a wider section of the valley to capture its scale. Andrews Peak (12,565'), Mt Alice (13,310'), Boulder Grand Pass (12,061'), Isolation Peak (13,118'), and Mt Craig (12,007') encase this grand basin. The unimproved trail continues on mild terrain to Spirit's open NE shore, and similarly through a patchy forest up to Fourth Lake (8.5 miles : 10,360'). Fourth Lake's east side opens to an idyllic meadow, a point worth reaching. The unimproved trail grows steep and is lightly traveled beyond this meadow en route to Fifth Lake (10,840') and Boulder Grand Pass (12,061'), which leads to Thunder Lake in Wild Basin.",129.0

Fern Lake is highly sought for its large trout stock and numerous backcountry campsites - expect crowds on this busy corridor during peak summer months. Visitors will enjoy good trail conditions, excellent fishing, 3-4 season access and connections for Cub Lake, Spruce Lake, Odessa Lake and Lake Helene on the hike to Fern Lake: The Fern Lake Trail rolls gently beside the Big Thompson River through aspen and mixed pine to The Pool - Cub Lake - Fern Lake Trail junction (1.8 miles : 8,365'). Many good fishing spots can be found on this mild stretch, a leafy corridor that yields berries, mushrooms, and bright autumn colors. Look for beaver, deer, elk and bear along the way. The trail weaves through cottage-size boulders known as Arch Rocks to the Pool, a churning whirlpool below the turbulent confluence of Spruce Creek, Fern Creek, and Big Thompson River. The trail climbs methodically above The Pool through dense fir and lodgepole to Fern Falls (2.65 miles : 8,855'), the only notable highlight on this lengthy segment. Grades moderate to the Spruce Lake Trail split (3.8 miles : 9,485'), where the forest opens on the northeast corner of Fern Lake (3.85 miles : 9,503'). You may continue on the Fern Lake Trail over its outlet to open areas on the east shore, or follow social trails to more secluded nooks and its free-falling inlet on the west shore. Those seeking a more adventurous outing should consider a side trip on the unimproved trail to comparably attractive (but much less crowded) Spruce Lake.

The hike to Andrews Tarn leads past Loch Vale and scales a steep ridge into an adjacent valley capped by Andrews Glacier:  The Loch Vale Trail rises over Glacier Creek through young aspen to Alberta Falls (.85 miles : 9,423'). It continues to the North Longs Peak Trail split (1.6 miles : 9,768'), where it banks SW and flattens through a gap between Thatchtop Mountain (12,668') and the Glacier Knobs. The trail drops to Glacier Junction (2.1 miles : 9,804'), a point marking the convergence of two immense glacial valleys. Follow signs to The Loch. The trail levels over Icy Brook, then steepens away on switchbacks into a thick forest (2.5 miles : 9,985'). The valley opens dramatically upon reaching The Loch (2.95 miles : 10,192'), where the main trail veers right up its north shore. The trail follows the shore back into the forest (3.3 miles : 10,215'), and the inlet to a pair of footbridges over Andrews Creek at the Sky Pond - Andrews Glacier Trail split (3.65 miles : 10,379'). Though well-marked, the Andrews Glacier Trail is not immediately visible from the signpost itself; to find it, backtrack several steps and look north up a rock slab. The trail picks up just above the rock slab and runs up the west side of Andrews Creek. The climb intensifies on a rugged, sparingly-defined path obstructed by dead fall and lingering snow. Remain vigilant to the Andrews Creek Campground (3.85 miles : 10,560'), where the trail bends northwest through treeline to a crest overlooking the Andrews Glacier valley. The trail crosses Andrews Creek (4.0 miles : 10,680') to the valley's north side and begins an arduous trek over scree and talus. Cairns offer guidance, but are fairly anonymous in the rocky landscape. Take your time through this uneven section. The valley narrows as you progress with emerging views of the Sharkstooth and snow fingers within The Gash. The trail reaches a small glacier in the valley center and crosses back over Andrews Creek to the south side (4.45 miles : 11,137'). This is a critical maneuver, as travel up or north of this glacier requires technical equipment. Follow cairns over the creek and make one final, steep push to Andrews Tarn (4.65 miles : 11,390').

It scales a small knoll to the east shore (4.85 miles), where you'll turn east for a strenuous climb up Black Lake's inlet into the tundra. The initial climb follows a well-defined path beside the inlet with exceptional views of the cirque below. It reaches an unmarked fork (5.15 miles : 11,980'), at which point you'll ignore both options and turn sharply left off-trail and up the hillside (north). The informal route negotiates some minor obstacles (rock crevices, talus, willow thickets), but other than a steep pitch, is fairly moderate and intuitive. A handful of cairns prove useful, but needn't be followed precisely. The route crests a small ridge (5.4 miles : 11,210') and drops to Blue Lake (5.5 miles : 11,165'). Blue Lake's shore is mostly open rock slab that's prone to strong wind.

You'll pass the Glacier Gorge Backcountry Campsite spur (3.35 miles : 10,068') and scale newly built stairs. Travel intensifies in a thick forest to a cairn-marked rock slab (3.85 miles : 10,205'), then moderates across a meadow with good views of the upper gorge (4.1 miles). The Arrowhead (12,387'), Powell Peak (13,208) and McHenrys Peak (13,327') frame the west, while Pagoda Mountain (13,497') and Keyboard of the Winds - a line of pinnacles near the summit of Longs Peak - rise to the east. Chiefs Head Peak (13,579') and The Spearhead (12,575') cap the upper valley. Uneven travel continues to the base of Ribbon Falls (4.7 miles : 10,540'), which spill from the north shore of Black Lake. The trail twists steeply beside the falls and hops a line of flattened boulders across the outlet to reach Black Lake (4.8 miles : 10,630'). It scales a small knoll to the east shore (4.85 miles), where you'll turn east and begin a strenuous climb up Black Lake's inlet. The initial climb follows a well-defined path beside the inlet with views of the cirque below. The trail reaches an unmarked fork at 5.15 miles (11,980'); bear right (south) and cross the stream to regain it. The trail threads dense willow and large boulders to a second crossing (5.27 miles); once over it twists steeply through a cairn-marked slot and moderates in a vast alpine terrace of rock slabs, meadows, ponds, boulders and streams. The path quickly fades, and you'll now turn southwest for the most direct route to Frozen Lake. First, identify the Spearhead and steep rock face to its right. No matter the approach, you'll eventually need to scale this wall to reach the lake, located just behind it. Orient yourself accordingly and look for the clearest path. The seemingly smooth terrain ahead is in fact quite uneven - take no footstep for granted. Favor rock slabs, the tundra's most reliable and eco-sensitive footing. Head SW toward the Spearhead and rock face at its western base. Select the most favorable pitch up this wall. The most direct route crests at approximately 6.0 miles (11,613') and drops through talus field to the northeast shore of Frozen Lake (6.05 miles : 11,578'). Frozen Lake's rocky shoreline is hardly welcoming, but does have many sheltered nooks and high perches. Scramble over the south shore for views across the lake and valley below.",115.5

The lakes sit just above Timberline Falls in a deep valley capped by Taylor Glacier, Taylor Peak (13,153'), Powell Peak (13,208') and The Sharkstooth (12,630'). Visitors will enjoy a stop at Alberta Falls, The Loch and a challenging scramble up Timberline Falls on the hike to Glass Lake and Sky Pond: The Loch Vale Trail rises over Glacier Creek through young aspen and mixed pine to Alberta Falls (.85 miles : 9,423'). A moderate climb continues to the North Longs Peak Trail split (1.6 miles : 9,768'), where it banks southwest and levels through a gap between Thatchtop Mountain (12,668') and the Glacier Knobs. The trail drops to Glacier Junction (2.1 miles : 9,804'), a point marking the convergence of two glacial valleys with access to some of Rocky Mountain's most renowned destinations. Follow signs to The Loch. Travel eases over Icy Brook, then steepens away on switchbacks in a thick forest (2.5 miles : 9,985'). The valley opens upon reaching The Loch (2.95 miles : 10,192'), where the main trail veers right up its north shore. The trail hugs the shore before re-entering a dark, stream-crossed forest on the Loch's west side (3.3 miles : 10,215'). Fishing is notably good on slow moving sections of the inlet. Travel moderates to a pair of footbridges spanning Andrews Creek at the Sky Pond Trail - Andrews Glacier Trail split (3.65 miles : 10,379'). It steepens considerably in a thinning forest to the base of Timberline Falls (4.0 miles : 10,642'), a misty cascade that drops sharply from the edge of Glass Lake. Here you'll begin a short but demanding climb up the north side of the falls. Though not technical, only confident hikers should attempt this. The trail is not marked but the path is quite intuitive (there's essentially only one way to go). Heavy run-off or lingering snow can make the climb treacherous - exercise caution. Groups should allow space between individuals. The trail abruptly crests atop the falls and levels in open alpine to Glass Lake (4.15 miles : 10,808'). Glass Lake features an emerald green hue and large, populous trout. Views back down valley are exceptional from the lake's north shore. The trail - rugged and indistinguishable at times - continues up the west side of Glass Lake through krummholz and talus to Sky Pond (4.5 miles : 10,887'). The space between the lakes is dotted with ponds, meadows and cascading streams, and worth exploring if time permits. Sky Pond, which is actually quite larger than Glass Lake, fills a rocky bowl encased by Taylor Glacier, Taylor Peak, the Sharkstooth and the Gash. Sky Pond's outlet can be safely crossed to find some of the best views over the two lakes.",115.5
215,Green Lake,rocky-mountain-national-park,12.3,9240,11555,2315,5,False,"Green Lake lies at the base of Pagoda Mountain in the southeast corner of Glacier Gorge. A popular trail leads 4.8 miles to Black Lake, past which a rugged x-country route continues 1.3 miles in a spectacular alpine landscape to Green Lake.  Anticipate steep, ill-defined conditions past Black Lake and plan travel time accordingly: The trail rises steadily through young aspen and mixed pine to Alberta Falls (.85 miles : 9,423'). A moderate climb continues to the North Longs Peak Trail split (1.6 miles : 9,768'), where it banks SW and flattens through a narrow slot between Thatchtop Mountain (12,668') and the Glacier Knobs. The trail drops to Glacier Junction and bears left to Mills Lake (2.1 miles : 9,804'). The trail turns south, crossing Glacier Creek twice and sections of cairn-marked rock slabs to Mills Lake (2.65 miles : 9,955'). Here you'll enjoy terrific views of Glacier Gorge and the jagged ridges and peaks that define it. The trail - now intermittently rugged, undulating and heavily rooted - follows the lake's east shore to its marshy juxtaposition with Jewel Lake (3.1 miles : 9,967'). It continues past Jewel Lake through a string of marshes aided by narrow, elevated planks. A cluttered forest reclaims the trail (3.2 miles), which closely follows Glacier Creek all the way to Black Lake. Anticipate steep undulations and occasional loss of clarity over the next 1.5 miles; when in doubt, simply hold your line and follow the creek. You'll pass the Glacier Gorge Backcountry Campsite spur (3.35 miles : 10,068') and scale newly built stairs.

The trail twists steeply beside the falls and hops a line of flat boulders across the outlet to Black Lake (4.8 miles : 10,630'). It scales a small knoll to the east shore (4.85 miles), where you'll turn east and begin a strenuous climb up Black Lake's inlet into the tundra. The initial climb follows a well-defined path beside the inlet with exceptional views of the cirque below. It reaches an unmarked fork at 5.15 miles (11,980'), where some map depictions of a clear path east of this stream belie the actual landscape before you. Though you'll trace this stream all the way to Green Lake, you'll necessarily favor its west side, as the east side is generally unsuitable for efficient travel. Bear right at this fork and cross the stream to regain the trail. It threads dense willow and large boulders to a second, more precarious stream crossing (5.27 miles); once through it levels in a sprawling alpine terrace of rock slabs, meadow, ponds, boulder fields and streams. The on-off again trail is gradually absorbed by it, leaving navigation to a good map, eye and intuitive read of the landscape. Cairns offer guidance, but note that many run off to climbing routes, improvised campsites or simply nowhere in particular. The trail follows the stream into the valley's southeast corner, its origin - and your destination - increasingly clear. The final approach crosses a perennial snowfield and squeezes through a narrow chute that levels on the rocky shore of Green Lake (6.15 miles : 11,555'). A relatively mild climb leads above Green Lake to a small tarn at the foot of Pagoda Mountain.",115.5
216,Lake Haiyaha (RMNP - Glacier Gorge Trailhead),rocky-mountain-national-park,6.95,9240,10221,981,3,False,"Lake Haiyaha is accessible from two popular trailheads in Rocky Mountain National Park: The Bear Lake Trailhead provides a maintained and more direct route, while the Glacier Gorge Trailhead follows a longer, slightly more challenging one that includes 1.3 miles of unimproved trail.  Hikers should have little trouble on this lightly used alternative through a cluttered, unspoiled forest. Haiyaha is an indigenous Indian word meaning 'rock', which aptly describes this secluded, boulder-riddled lake setting in lower Chaos Canyon. Hallet Peak (12,713') and Otis Peak (12,486') stand over Lake Haiyaha on the Continental Divide; the glacier between them carved out this canyon millennia ago, churning and depositing boulders throughout the basin: The Loch Vale Trail rises steadily through young aspen and mixed pine to Alberta Falls (.85 miles : 9,423'). A moderate climb continues to the North Longs Peak Trail split (1.6 miles : 9,768'), where it banks southwest and levels through a narrow gorge between Thatchtop Mountain (12,668') and the Glacier Knobs. The trail drops to Glacier Junction, where you'll bear right (north) onto the unimproved trail to Lake Haiyaha. No horses are allowed beyond this point. The unimproved trail undulates - abruptly at times - through a busy subalpine forest. Despite its unmaintained classification the trail is fairly well defined and easy to follow (remain vigilant as snow, overgrowth, or animal tracks can obscure the path). The trail reaches an outdated 'End of Trail' / directional sign for Haiyaha near a small pond (2.6 miles : 9,880'); simply follow the sign's guidance and continue on. Take a few steps off trail into clearings by the pond for good views of the Continental Divide. The trail crosses three small footbridges in quick succession just past an opening in the forest along a south-facing slope. It makes a hairpin turn west (left) over the third bridge (2.9 miles : 10,065') and steepens up uneven switchbacks to the Lake Haiyaha - Dream Lake Trail split (3.2 miles : 10,184'). Expect rough footing on the final .25 mile approach, especially under winter conditions. Lake Haiyaha's (3.45 miles : 10,221') shore is guarded by large boulders and talus, requiring nimble feet and minor scrambling to move about. The northeast corner provides the most direct views up Chaos Canyon. Look for summer raspberries amid the boulders.",116.0

It arcs 13 miles northeast to Flattop Mountain on the Continental Divide, forming the western half of the most popular thru-hike in Rocky Mountain National Park. While few tackle the Tonahutu in its entirety, many use it to access Big Meadows, an aptly named expanse that supports large numbers of elk and moose. The Tonahutu route into Big Meadows is longer than beginning at Green Mountain Trailhead, but preferable for lighter crowds and a particularly active wildlife corridor along the creek. Mild grades and good trail conditions are ideal for families, backpackers and winter recreation, and anglers will enjoy easy access to deep oxbows in a pastoral setting. The following description begins at the Kawuneeche Visitor Center on the Tonahutu Spur: The trail heads east through dense lodgepole to join the main Tonahutu Trail at .65 miles (8,695'). The Tonahutu Trail steepens past Harbison Ditch (.8 miles), then levels for an extended period. Though the canopy is badly marred by beetle kill, the forest floor is brightened by flowers and a verdant herbaceous layer. Deadfall creates useful viewing lanes, and late-summer travelers will enjoy mushrooms and raspberry patches along the way. Tonahutu Creek is first visible at 1.1 miles, where the forest gradually opens and diversifies. Medium-sized meadows appear at 1.7 and 2.2 miles before a third opening reveals a long, open corridor that you'll follow into the main meadow (3.0 miles : 9,325').

Mummy Mountain looms east, while Fairchild Mountain (13,502') and Hagues Peak (13,560') stand north of an unnamed 12,541' peak directly over Lawn Lake's west shore. The main trail continues on to Crystal Lakes and 'The Saddle', a 12,398' pass between Fairchild Mountain and Hagues Peak. HistoryLawn Lake was once dammed. On July 15, 1982 its 26' high earthen dam failed, releasing 674 acre-feet (219,724,000 gallons) of water at an estimated peak discharge rate of 18,000 cubic feet (134,640 gallons) per second down the Roaring River valley. Three people were killed and damages totaled $31 million. As a result, sections of the Roaring River's high banks are unstable and prone to sudden collapse. Lawn Lake's south shoreline still bears the scars of this catastrophic event, though nature is rapidly reclaiming it.",101.516666667
226,Ypsilon Lake,rocky-mountain-national-park,8.75,8540,10632,2092,4,False,"Ypsilon Lake is located 4.4 miles from the Lawn Lake Trailhead in Rocky Mountain National Park. It lies in a confined, heavily wooded basin on the east slope of Ypsilon Mountain (13,514') and Mount Chiquita (13,069') in the Park's lightly traveled Mummy Range. While much of the hike climbs arduously through nondescript forest, visitors will enjoy notably good cutthroat trout fishing at Ypsilon Lake, and excellent views of the Mummy Range from the upper valley: The Lawn Lake Trail climbs 534' to the level east bank of Roaring River with good views over Horseshoe Park on the ascent (1.0 mile : 9,074'). The trail turns north up level banks to the Ypsilon Lake Trail split (1.45 miles : 9,190'). The trail crosses over a passive section of river and turns sharply southwest for a steep climb through uniform lodgepole. Travel eases briefly at 2 miles and turns decisively northwest up a narrow, heavily wooded ridge. Here the trail begins a moderately steep and rugged climb with few notable features until cresting at 3.8 miles (10,762') and dropping to Chipmunk Lake (4.0 miles : 10,682'), a small pond with views of Ypsilon Mountain and Fairchild Mountain (13,502'). The trail undulates on the valley floor to the cluttered northwest shore of Ypsilon Lake (4.37 miles : 10,664'). Views are quite limited from this point, but you can follow social trails south to clearings along the outlet. A logjam here encumbers circumnavigation, however the outlet spills into a very pretty, more accessible meadow seldom explored by day hikers. A social trail also leads to the lake's north shore where a lively waterfall powered by the Chiquita Lake and Spectacle Lakes' outlet drops through a steep, narrow chute. An unmaintained trail continues above the falls approximately .75 miles to Spectacle Lakes, which lie in a tightly bound cirque beneath Ypsilon Mountain. Reaching them requires good endurance and basic scrambling skills.",101.516666667
227,Lily Lake,rocky-mountain-national-park,0.9,8930,8930,0,1,False,"Lily Lake is located six miles south of Estes Park, just east of the Rocky Mountain National Park boundary along Highway 7. This short loop at the base of Estes Cone provides sweeping views that include Mt Meeker ( 13,911'), Twin Sisters (11,428'), and Longs Peak (14,259') - the highest point in Rocky Mountain National Park. Lily Lake is ideal for families or those with limited time or abilities. Maximize sunlight by traveling clockwise in the morning, and counterclockwise in the evening.  Extend your trip by hiking the Lily Ridge Trail, which breaks off the loop and climbs 350' in just .2 miles to Lily Ridge above the lake.  Enos Mills - the Father of Rocky Mountain National Park The landscape surrounding Lily Lake inspired a young naturalist named Enos Mills and led to the formation of Rocky Mountain National Park.  In 1884, at only fourteen years old, Mills left Kansas and moved to Colorado, settling in a cabin at the base of Longs Peak. The following year he climbed Longs Peak for the first time, a feat he'd repeat over 250 times.  Mills spent his entire life devoted to the conservation of the Rocky Mountains and in 1907 he proposed that this region of the Rockies be officially designated as a national park. In 1915, his dream became reality with the establishment of Rocky Mountain National Park. Mills died seven years later but his dedication to the preservation of this area will live on forever.",95.7666666667
228,Chasm Lake,rocky-mountain-national-park,8.4,9405,11803,2398,4,False,"Chasm Lake is located 4.2 miles from the Longs Peak Trailhead in Rocky Mountain National Park. It fills a deep cirque carved from the base of Mt Meeker (13,911'), Longs Peak (14,259') and Mount Lady Washington (13,281'). Longs Peak's iconic 'Diamond' rises 2456' above this striking alpine lake. Visitors will enjoy miles of open tundra and sensational views on the hike to Chasm Lake: The trail climbs steadily from the Longs Peak Ranger Station through lodgepole, spruce and fir. Alpine Brook, largely concealed by timber, is the only notable feature before crossing the top of a long cascade at treeline (1.85 miles : 10,615'), where the forest is quickly reduced to bands of krummholz. Krummholz - a German word meaning twisted wood - describes the stunted, irregular growth patterns of trees in the ecological transition zone between subalpine forests and alpine tundra. Poor soil, thin air and extreme weather limit growth at these elevations. Still, the tundra's nutrient-rich grasses, plants, and lichens support marmot, elk, bighorn sheep and mountain goat. The trail bends toward the Longs Peak diamond from the Battle Mountain Backcountry Campsite spur (2.45 miles : 10,956') to the Chasm Lake - East Longs Peak Trail split (3.25 miles : 11,518'). Stock is not permitted on the Chasm Lake Trail beyond this point. The trail bears SW along the north wall of a deep gorge carved by Roaring Fork (Chasm's outlet) with views of Peacock Pool. It crests and drops across a steep slope to an alpine bench that spans the upper valley and separates upper and lower Columbine Falls (3.8 miles : 11,580'). This short segment is narrow, slanted and susceptible to slides. Traction devices are useful when snow-covered. The trail levels across this stream-crossed bench to the south side of the valley and Patrol Cabin (4.0 miles : 11,638'). Here the trail - more of a scrambling route chiseled from rock - climbs .2 miles to Chasm Lake. Large boulders and uneven talus ring the lake, requiring some minor scrambling to the best viewpoints. An unimproved route circles Chasm Lake's talus-strewn north wall to the base of Mills Glacier, a shrinking remnant of the area's active glacial past.",95.8
229,Estes Cone,rocky-mountain-national-park,6.1,9425,11002,1577,4,False,"Estes Cone is located 3.05 miles from the Longs Peak Trailhead on the east side of Rocky Mountain National Park. A short but steep climb up this conical formation offers panoramic views of Longs Peak, the Continental Divide and Estes Park area:  The trail climbs steadily in a mixed pine forest to the Chasm Lake - Estes Cone Trail split and turns sharply north (.45 miles : 9,670'). It continues on a moderate grade that levels over a stream (1.3 miles) to the Eugenia Mine site - a settler era gold mine which in the words of the Park ""produced more dreams than gold"". The trail dips past the mine to Moore Park Backcountry Campsite (1.6 miles : 9,732') and begins a steep push to the summit, covering almost 1,000' in the final .7 miles. Cairns help identify the trail, but can be difficult to spot, especially with lingering snow. A 20 yard scramble up steep scree leads to the bare-rock summit of Estes Cone (3.05 miles : 11,002'). The Cone's pinnacle offers rangy views across the Continental Divide, Estes Park and Lumpy Ridge area. Many named peaks can be identified from the top including Twin Sisters, Hallet Peak and Flattop Mountain.",95.8
230,Mount Lady Washington,rocky-mountain-national-park,11.8,9405,13281,3876,4,False,"Mount Lady Washington (13,281') is located next to Longs Peak (14,259'), and is one of three peaks that form the Chasm Lake cirque (Mt Meeker, Longs Peak and MLW). No trail leads to the summit, however it's a relatively short, moderate excursion off the Longs Peak Trail to the top.  The route shares the first 3.25 miles with Chasm Lake to the East Longs Peak Trail, which makes a counter-clockwise arc around the base of Mount Lady Washington to Granite Pass and the Boulderfield. You'll leave the main trail just before reaching the Boulderfield for a .45 mile, 700' scramble to the summit: The trail climbs steadily from Longs Peak Ranger Station past connections for Estes Cone (.5 miles) and Goblins Forest backcountry campsite (1.1 miles : 10,127'). Alpine Brook, largely concealed by timber, is the only notable feature until crossing the top of a long cascade at treeline (1.85 miles : 10,615'), where the forest quickly shrinks to bands of krummholz. It clears treeline to the Battle Mountain Backcountry Campsite spur (2.45 miles : 10,956'), and up to the Chasm Lake - East Longs Peak Trail split (3.25 miles : 11,518'). The East Longs Peak Trail splits NW and moderates along the base of Mount Lady Washington to Granite Pass and the North Longs Peak Trail split (4.3 miles : 12,098'). It's possible to peel off along this stretch and aim for the summit, however there's easier access ahead. Granite Pass spans a divisive ridge between the Boulder Brook and Roaring Fork drainages, with exceptional views over each. Views are arguably more interesting to the north and west, which include long sections of the Continental Divide, Mummy and Never Summer ranges. The East Longs Peak Trail turns sharply SW from Granite Pass around the north side of Mount Lady Washington and switchbacks moderately into the high tundra. Travel gradually levels and straightens out with an up-close look at Longs Peak and Storm Peak (13,326'), a prominent summit located just across the tundra flats (4.8 miles : 12,305'). Mount Lady Washington is now tempting, but best to wait for a large cairn at 5.45 miles (12,625'), located a few hundred yards shy of the Boulderfield. Breaking off too early will lead you through challenging (and unnecessary) talus. Leave the trail at 5.45 miles and make a straight line across soft tundra turf to the rocky base of MLW. There's a very faint boot track here that twists steeply to a small notch on the summit, somehow avoiding the worst of the sharp and unstable talus. Scramble left from the saddle / notch to reach Mount Lady Washington and the summit log (5.9 miles : 13,281'), and right for even better views of Longs Peak.",95.8
231,Gem Lake,rocky-mountain-national-park,3.3,7882,8830,948,4,False,"Gem Lake is located 1.65 miles from the Lumpy Ridge Trailhead on the northeast side of Rocky Mountain National Park. It fills a shallow depression near the top of Lumpy Ridge, a massive granite rock complex home to numerous raptor species and world class climbing.  Gem Lake is unusual in that there's no true inlet or outlet stream - surrounding rock traps, collects, and steers water into the small basin. The lake faces south at a modest elevation, meaning less snow and faster melt that make it one of Rocky Mountain's most accessible 4 season hikes. In May 2007 the Twin Owls Trailhead was relocated approximately .5 miles to the east and re-named Lumpy Ridge Trailhead. The new trailhead - which accesses Gem Lake, the Twin Owls Loop and all Lumpy Ridge climbing destinations - holds more parking and updated park information. Some maps do not illustrate the recent move. Signs at Lumpy Ridge Trailhead clearly depict new routing and distances affected by the relocation: The trail climbs steeply through mature ponderosa and aspen all the way to Gem Lake. Sculpted granite boulders line the trail and lend to the area's unique aesthetic. Autumn visitors will enjoy brilliant colors and a gold carpet of fallen leaves. Openings in the forest yield rangy panoramas that include Longs Peak (14,259'), Estes Cone (11,011'), Taylor Peak (13,163'), Powell Peak (13,208'), McHenrys Peak (13,327'), and the Estes Park area. The moderately-strenuous grade levels out only upon reaching Gem Lake. The lake's west shore is beach-like, while the north and east shores are encased by vertical granite walls that can be reached from their flat base just above waterline. The trail continues past Gem Lake on longer routes to Bridal Veil Falls and the Twin Owls Loop.",93.6
232,Twin Owls Loop,rocky-mountain-national-park,11.05,7870,9134,1264,4,False,"The Twin Owls Loop circles and scales Lumpy Ridge, a massive granite rock complex located in the NE section of Rocky Mountain National Park. It passes through ponderosa parks, riparian corridors, montane and lower-subalpine forests, making it one of the most ecologically diverse trails in the Park.  This lightly traveled loop is highlighted by abundant wildlife, terrific views, mature aspen groves and exceptional autumn foliage. The following description travels clockwise from the Lumpy Ridge Trailhead, recommended for morning light across the MacGregor Ranch meadows. Note that, regardless of direction, the trail begins outside Park Boundaries and staying on designated trails is required: The trail undulates along the south slope of Lumpy Ridge to the National Park Boundary and Gem Lake spur (.6 miles). It winds through sculpted boulders and mixed forest to the former Twin Owls Parking Lot, past which it splits left down the Black Canyon Trail (.75 miles). The trail drops through a broad, south-facing meadow with panoramas of Longs Peak (14,259'), Estes Cone (11,011'), Taylor Peak (13,163'), Powell Peak (13,208') and McHenrys Peak (13,327'). It passes climbing access points (The Book Area: 1.55 miles, The Pear: 1.87 miles), enters a thick ponderosa forest (2.0 miles), and re-enters the Park through a gate (2.1 miles : 7,990'). Here it begins a long, steady climb to the Black Canyon Trail split (3.88 miles : 9,092'). Note how ponderosa gradually cede to lodgepole and fir as you gain elevation. Bear right (east) toward Cow Creek Trailhead to resume the loop. The trail reaches its max elevation at 4 miles (9,134'), then tilts on a moderately steep descent through mature aspen to the north side of Lumpy Ridge. The north side of Lumpy Ridge is a broad, verdant valley fed by Cow Creek and lined by thick aspen groves. Look for deer, elk, bear, fox, coyote and turkey in this food-rich environment. The trail drops gently past the Peregrine Backcountry Campsite (5.55 miles : 8,330'), a creek crossing (5.65 miles : 8,292'), Bridal Veil Falls Trail split (5.7 miles : 8,278'), and Rabbit Ears Backcountry Campsite (6.34 miles : 8,134') to the Gem Lake split (6.5 miles : 8,135'). Follow signs for Gem Lake. The trail undulates through commingled aspen, ponderosa, lodgepole, spruce, and fir to the final crossing of Cow Creek (6.7 miles : 8,057') at the base of Lumpy Ridge, where it begins an arduous climb to Gem Lake. A mostly unforgiving grade yields excellent views of the valley below and glimpses of Mount Ypsilon (13,514') and Fairchild Mountain (13,502') in the distant Mummy Range. The trail finally moderates on a verdant plateau to the Balanced Rock Trail spur (8.15 miles : 8,665'), where it abruptly drops and rises to Gem Lake (9.4 miles : 8,830'). Gem Lake fills a shallow granite depression atop Lumpy Ridge - expect crowds at this popular destination. A rough trail drops steeply from Gem Lake for 1.65 miles through an aspen-ponderosa forest back to the trailhead to complete the loop (11.05 miles : 7,870').",93.6
233,Moraine Park Loop,rocky-mountain-national-park,4.65,8038,8038,90,1,False,"Rocky Mountain National Park's landscape has been shaped by the cyclical growth, recession and reconstitution of glaciers over many millennia. Glacial movement grinds the land beneath it, depositing till on its margins that accumulate on ridges called moraines.  Wide, flat depressions sometimes form where glaciers end their downhill progression, ringed by the land (moraines) they've displaced. Moraine Park is one such place where glaciers once settled and subsequently receded, leaving a broad, level expanse in its place. Moraine Park is cut by the Big Thompson River and Cub Creek, which hold abundant trout and support an array of wildlife. Every fall large elk herds congregate in these food-rich meadows for their annual rut, a spectacular ritual where dominant bulls battle for mating rights. Mule deer gather in smaller numbers and are common throughout the year. Small mammals like squirrels, voles and rabbit attract larger predators such as coyote, fox, bobcat and raptors, while bears seek out late summer berries along the meadow's perimeter. All plays out before the Continental Divide, a backdrop that runs from Longs Peak (south) to Mount Chiquita (13,069'), Ypsilon Mountain (13,514') and Fairchild Mountain (13,502') of the Mummy Range to the north. The Moraine Park Loop Trail is comprised of an informal trail and Cub Lake Road on the meadows' north side, the Cub Lake Trail (west), Lateral Moraine Trail (south) and a Park service road (east). The north side is flat and open, while the Lateral Moraine Trail undulates along the forested base of a moraine to the south. The loop's mild grades and good maintenance are ideal for families, runners and winter recreation. Anglers will enjoy easy access to miles of slow moving oxbows across the Moraine Park basin. The following description travels counter-clockwise from the Moraine Park Trailhead: An unnamed but clear path trail leads northwest of the parking beside the Big Thompson River through a vast sage-grass field to Cub Lake Road (.8 miles : 8,095'). Remain on the road (ignoring splits to the Moraine Park Campground and Livery) to the Cub Lake Trailhead on Moraine Park's west end (2.0 miles : 8,110'). Bear left (south) on the Cub Lake Trail, which crosses the Big Thompson and negotiates a few quick turns and hills to the unmarked but distinct Lateral Moraine Trail split (2.55 miles : 8,095'). Keep left. The Lateral Moraine Trail turns east between the base of a densely wooded moraine and Cub Creek. Be mindful of wildlife in this brushy, concealed space. The Lateral Moraine Trail merges with a Park Service Road (3.9 miles : 8,065') and continues east by several private residences and Park facilities. It gradually bends north (4.5 miles) on the final turn back to the trailhead and parking lot (4.65 miles : 8,038').",102.316666667
234,Cascade Falls (Rocky Mountain National Park),rocky-mountain-national-park,6.8,8545,8838,293,2,False,"Cascade Falls is located 3.4 miles from North Inlet Trailhead on the west side of Rocky Mountain National Park. This voluminous, multi-tier fall pours over large granite boulders along a wide section of North Inlet Creek.  While Cascade Falls is the main attraction, the creek itself and large meadows along its path are equally compelling. Fishing is notably good on the North Inlet, and moose and elk sightings are fairly common. The North Inlet Trail continues east with access to Lake Nokoni, Lake Nanita and Flattop Mountain on the Continental Divide. While these destinations are typically tackled as an overnight, there are several features along North Inlet that can be reached comfortably in a day for those with more time to explore. The Big Pool (9,080') is located 1.4 miles past Cascade Falls, a point where the powerful North Inlet is funneled through a narrow chute and slows into a large swirling pool. Ptarmigan Creek (9,345') is 3.25 miles from the falls, a major tributary of the North Inlet that can be traced via social trails and some moderate bushwhacking to Wardance Falls and its source at Bench Lake (10,120'): The trail begins on a level dirt road across private property to the edge of Summerland Park (1.2 miles : 8,530'). It narrows onto single track and arcs NE around large meadows partially veiled by thin bands of timber - ideal habitat for seeing wildlife. The trail undulates mildly into a lodgepole forest badly marred by pine beetles, though the herbaceous layer and creek corridor remain healthy and verdant. It rises nominally to Twinberry Backcountry Campsite (2.93 miles : 8,740'), then high along the north valley wall before leveling back to the creek and a spur for Cascade Falls (3.4 miles : 8,845'). Social trails branch down to viewing areas of the voluminous cascade; exercise caution when scrambling about this oft-slick area. Continue a few hundred yards past the falls into a large, luxuriant meadow fed by three major tributaries. This is an ideal place to find wildlife and solitude.",127.216666667

It lies at the head of an isolated valley framed by Ptarmigan Mountain (12,324') and Andrews Peak (12,565'). This long but moderate trail follows North Inlet Creek 7.45 miles before splitting off on a strenuous 3.35 mile climb to the lake. Camping is not permitted at Lake Nanita or nearby Lake Nokoni, which limits traffic and gives each an undisturbed feel. Ten backcountry campsites along the way are spread across miles of cascading streams and large meadows frequented by moose and elk (see map for campsite locations). Visitors will enjoy stops at Cascade Falls, The Big Pool, North Inlet Falls and Lake Nokoni on the hike to Lake Nanita: The trail begins on a level dirt road across private property to the edge of Summerland Park (1.2 miles : 8,530').

Social trails branch down to viewing areas of the voluminous cascade; exercise caution when scrambling about this oft-slick area. The trail continues above the falls around a large meadow, another great place to step out and scan for wildlife (4.0 miles : 8,950'). It reaches a bridge over Big Pool (4.8 miles : 9,080'), where the powerful North Inlet is funneled through a narrow granite chute and slows into a large swirling pool. This scenic area is a fine turnaround point if not aiming for the lakes. Mild grades expedite travel along the creek through damaged swathes of forest, with more frequent intervals of healthy spruce and fir deeper in the backcountry. The trail skirts another large meadow complex (6.0 miles : 9,295') to Grouseberry Backcountry Campsite (6.3 miles : 9.315'), North Inlet Group Site (6.4 miles : 9,330') and a bridge over Ptarmigan Creek (6.65 miles : 9,345'). A faint social trail splits NE up Ptarmigan Creek to Wardance Falls and its source at Bench Lake. The main trail continues east to Porcupine Backcountry Campsite (6.75 miles : 9,378'), past which it climbs away from the creek on switchbacks to the Lake Nanita Trail Split (7.45 miles : 9,585'). Here the North Inlet Trail veers NE on a 4.6 mile climb to Flattop Mountain (12,234') on the Continental Divide, and the Lake Nanita Trail drops south to a scenic bridge across North Inlet Falls (7.6 miles : 9,515').

This long but moderate trail follows North Inlet Creek 7.45 miles before splitting off on a 2.35 mile, 1190' climb to the lake. Camping is not permitted at Lake Nokoni or nearby Lake Nanita, which limits traffic and gives each a decidedly natural feel. Ten backcountry campsites along the way offer staging points for reaching the lakes, though Nokoni is accessible in a day for strong hikers with an early start (see map for all campsite locations).

237,Onahu Creek Trail to Long Meadows,rocky-mountain-national-park,8.9,8792,10220,1428,3,False,"The Onahu Creek Trail joins the unmaintained Long Meadows Trail to form a varied x-country route to the south edge of Long Meadows. This two mile meadow system is lightly traveled but rife with wildlife, particularly elk and moose. Visitors will enjoy rare solitude and excellent wildlife viewing on the hike to Long Meadows.  It's worth noting that park signs and various maps differ on the length of unimproved travel, as well the exact route (see more in Worth Noting below). Regardless, hikers should anticipate several miles of x-country travel on uneven terrain and plan travel time accordingly: The Onahu Creek Trail heads NE on a moderate grade in a tall lodgepole forest. It crosses Onahu Creek at 1.35 miles (9,240') and closely follows it much of the way to the Long Meadows Trail. Note the introduction of spruce and fir as you climb higher. You'll cross Onahu Creek again just before reaching the Long Meadows Trail split (2.8 miles : 9,630'), where a sign points north and indicates that 1.6 miles of unimproved conditions lie ahead. Good navigational instincts and a fair amount of athleticism are now required. Steep terrain, stream crossings, deadfall, boulders and an absence of trail markings make travel difficult. While the upper trail is quite easy to follow, the first few hundred yards are challenging from a navigational standpoint. The faint route can be covered with snow well into summer, stream crossings are unaided, and well-worn animal tracks can lead off-course. Just past the split for Long Meadows, bear left on the west edge of a small marshy meadow - the trail is very faint here. This will lead to the stream where an old footbridge - currently defunct and impassable - indicates a good spot to cross and pick up the trail again. If you travel straight through and / or along the marsh's eastern edge, you will eventually cross the same stream and have a similar challenge of regaining the trail once across. Regardless of your route, understanding where the trail is generally heading will likely place you back on it. This is part of the fun! The trail is notably easier to follow as you climb higher. The final .3+ miles travel up switchbacks on a steep, south-facing slope. This is an especially pretty stretch of forest. The trail levels out just over a ridge on the edge of a small pond, around which you can travel in either direction. Long Meadows is just north of this pond. Timber gives way to open space on the southernmost edge of Long Meadows (4.45 miles : 10,220'). Signs of moose and elk are virtually everywhere, and the vast open space makes wildlife spotting quite easy. Explore the meadow to fully appreciate its size, and improve your chance of seeing wildlife.",135.1
238,Cache La Poudre Trail,rocky-mountain-national-park,18.4,10747,9753,-994,3,False,"The Cache La Poudre Trail begins at the Poudre Lake Trailhead on the west side of Rocky Mountain National Park. It follows the Cache La Poudre River 9.2 miles down a wide open valley to the Mummy Pass Trail junction, 1.3 miles from the Corral Creek Trailhead in the Comanche Peak Wilderness.  This lightly used trail offers excellent wildlife viewing, solitude and big open spaces. Mild terrain and modest elevation gains make the Cache La Poudre Trail achievable in a day, but consider camping overnight to fully explore and enjoy this immense river-valley corridor: The trail begins north of Poudre Lake on the west side of the valley, and immediately drops to the west side of the headwater. It runs close to the forest edge, but mostly through open space on a gentle, rolling grade. The first 4.5 miles are an unmaintained cross-country route between the river and forest. Despite that classification, the trail is fairly well-defined and intuitively followed. Hikers should have little trouble keeping track of their location given the distinct path it takes down valley and by the river. The same path is used extensively by elk, which readily take this path of least-resistance. The trail loses clarity through 4.5 miles (10,338') as you pass a forested knoll on the west side of the valley - edge back down toward the river, and the trail will soon reappear. You'll reach spurs for the Cache Campsite and Chapin Creek Campsite along a good section of trail (approx 5.25 miles and 5.5 miles from the trailhead). Note these signs may be in disrepair and difficult to see - if camping, anticipate these signs and use a map for guidance. Here you'll notice the main valley narrowing, and branching into smaller valleys that run W-NW. The trail now runs through intervals of dense montane forest before emerging in a long, open area adjacent to the river (7.2 miles : 9,985'). It re-enters the forest on a high bank (8.25 miles), then drops to a willow-marsh along an oxbow (8.8 miles : 9,965'). Travel levels to the Mummy Pass Trail split at a major bridge (9.2 miles : 9,753'). The Mummy Pass Trail turns east over the bridge to the Hague Creek Campsite, located just above the confluence of Hague Creek and the Cache La Poudre. It continues 2.6 miles east to the Mirror Lake Trail junction. You may also hike another .5 miles from the Mummy Pass Trail split to the Park Boundary and Corral Creek Trailhead in the Comanche Peak Wilderness.",145.15
239,Milner Pass Trail,rocky-mountain-national-park,8.2,10753,11796,1043,2,False,"The Milner Pass Trail runs 4.1 miles from Poudre Lake to the Alpine Visitor Center in Rocky Mountain National Park. The hike begins with a short, steep climb that moderates through treeline and open tundra to Fall River Pass on Trail Ridge Road.  Views are exceptional, highlighted by lengthy sections of the Never Summer Range, Cache La Poudre River valley and Forest Canyon. Few Park trails offer as much alpine exposure on such mild grades. The Poudre Lake Trailhead is located on Milner Pass (10,759') along the Continental Divide. The 'Great Divide' separates drainages that flow into the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The Cache La Poudre forms just north of Milner Pass and drains into the Platte River, which flows into the Missouri River and eventually the Mississippi before reaching the Gulf of Mexico (Atlantic). South of Milner Pass, Beaver Creek drains into the Colorado River, which flows through the Grand Canyon and into the Gulf of California (Pacific): The trail begins on the south edge of Poudre Lake, where you'll find signs for Milner Pass and Mt Ida a few steps from the trailhead on the lakeshore. It turns sharply uphill and winds through a pretty subalpine forest to the Milner Pass - Mt Ida Trail split (.6 miles : 11,072'). The Milner Pass Trail turns northeast and levels in a thinning forest with emerging views of the Never Summer Range. It moves quickly through glades that widen to expansive meadows where elk and deer are common (1.75 miles). It rises nominally to Forest Canyon Pass (2.5 miles : 11,320'), where you can take a few steps off trail and peer down Forest Canyon and the headwaters of the Big Thompson River. Look for bighorn sheep on higher slopes, and moose by a string of alpine ponds and meadows just beyond the pass. The trail clears treeline with views across the upper Cache La Poudre River Valley, which runs over 9 miles north from Milner Pass (read about x-country travel on the Cache La Poudre River Trail). It keeps a modest grade to the terminus on Trail Ridge Road at the Alpine Visitor Center (4.1 miles : 11,796'). Take advantage of the visitor center's educational resources, and back deck with terrific views of the Mummy Range across Fall River Pass.",146.016666667
240,Mt Ida,rocky-mountain-national-park,9.6,10753,12889,2136,4,False,"Mt Ida (12,889') is located 4.8 miles from Poudre Lake Trailhead in Rocky Mountain National Park. It's arguably one of the Park's finest alpine treks, but receives little attention because the trail does not appear on most maps, and the trailhead itself makes no mention of Mt Ida as a destination. Despite its classification as a cross-country route, the Mt Ida Trail is in fact well-defined (save the final approach), and quite moderate by Rocky Mountain standards. Note that trail signs suggest the summit is only 4.0 miles, a small but significant discrepancy at these elevations. Plan travel time accordingly. 3.6 miles of the trail run through open tundra - get an early start to avoid thunderstorms that reliably develop each afternoon throughout the summer. The last 1.3 miles are not well defined, but follow cairns and an intuitive route up to the summit. Visitors will enjoy spectacular landscapes that include expansive tundra flats and panoramic views across the Never Summer Range, Gorge Lakes and lightly traveled interior mountains: The trail begins on the south edge of Poudre Lake, where you'll find signs for Milner Pass and Mt Ida a few steps from the trailhead on the lakeshore. It turns sharply uphill and winds through a pretty subalpine forest to the Milner Pass - Mt Ida Trail split (.6 miles : 11,072'). The Mt Ida Trail turns south and climbs steadily before moderating through the vestiges of treeline (1.2 miles : 11,392'). Here you'll have stunning views across the Never Summer Range, and south along the Divide. Look for bighorn sheep and elk, which frequent these high slopes. The trail heads S-SE just west of and below the Divide on a variously mild and moderate grade. Though very clear, be mindful of equally well-defined game trails that follow a similar route. The trail undulates to a cairn-marked fork on the edge of an expansive flat (2.8 miles : 12,140') - bear right. It dips across the flat to a saddle on the Divide (3.4 miles : 12,015'), which overlooks a pretty alpine meadow down the east side (GPS Point #10). Though seemingly accessible, snow cornices make the tempting drop-in only for the skilled and equipped. The trail reaches the far side of the saddle, where it abruptly fades in decidedly rockier terrain (3.5 miles :12,037'). Here you'll begin the 1.3 mile cross-country portion of the hike, which follows cairns and a decent boot track on an arcing push to the summit. It's difficult to pick out every cairn in this indistinguishable terrain, but obvious where you must go - up. Tread lightly on delicate grasses and step on rock whenever possible. Mt Ida (4.8 miles : 12,889') is just a small rocky nub atop the Continental Divide, but optimally located with exceptional views of the Never Summer Range (west), and Gorge Lakes basin (east). Maneuver about the summit for views of Highest Lake, Azure Lake, Inkwell Lake, Arrowhead Lake and their glacial benefactors. These lakes form the headwaters of a major tributary to the Big Thompson River, which cuts through Forest Canyon below. It's possible to drop into this idyllic basin, but requires significant route finding and athleticism. A razor-thin saddle connects Ida with neighboring Chief Cheley Peak (12,504'), which joins Cracktop (12,766'), Mount Julian (12,928') and Terra Tomah Mountain (12,718') to form the massive Gorge Lakes cirque. Julian Lake is also visible in an adjacent cirque to the southwest.",146.016666667
241,Sprague Lake Nature Loop,rocky-mountain-national-park,0.8,8720,8720,10,1,False,"Sprague Lake is located just south of Bear Lake Road on the east side of Rocky Mountain National Park. Visitors will enjoy an easy loop around this scenic upper-montane lake with panoramas of the Continental Divide that include Hallett Peak (12,713'), Otis Peak (12,486') and Taylor Peak (13,153'). A short bridge leaves the parking lot, crosses an inlet stream and connects with the nature loop. Anglers will enjoy well-stocked waters and an accessible - albeit often crowded - 13 acre shoreline. The Sprague Lake Picnic Area, located within the parking lot, maintains modern rest facilities, fire pits and tables that can accommodate larger groups. Those seeking longer day hikes from this location can explore a second trailhead (adjacent to the nature loop within the parking lot) that accesses Storm Pass, Glacier Junction and Bear Lake. Before becoming a national park in 1915, the Sprague Lake area was home to a mountain resort run by Abner and Alberta Sprague. Other than the eponymous lake few, signs of their ambitious recreational project remain today, as the area has been effectively rehabilitated.",111.316666667
242,Boulder Brook Trail,rocky-mountain-national-park,4.8,8831,10311,1430,3,False,"The Boulder Brook Trail connects Rocky Mountain's Bear Lake Road corridor with the North Longs Peak Trail, offering an alternative and seldom used overnight route to Longs Peak.  This unassumingly attractive trail closely follows Boulder Brook through the upper-montane zone into archetypal subalpine forests. Solitude seekers will enjoy its lively waters, diverse riparian vegetation, terrific autumn foliage, and good views of the Continental Divide and Mummy Range: The trail drops from the trailhead to the brook, crosses a bridge (.12 miles) and gradually rises away through a tall lodgepole forest. It continues south past the Sprague Lake connector (.25 miles) and Glacier Creek - Storm Pass trail split (.37 miles), where it officially becomes the Boulder Brook Trail. Horses are not permitted beyond this point. The trail rejoins Boulder Brook at .55 miles (9,095') and turns sharply uphill. A steep climb beside the creek is highlighted by several waterfalls, aspen, deep green mosses and lush ground vegetation. Autumn colors are notably good on this stretch. The grade eases through .75 miles (9,430'), where small clearings yield good views of Hallet Peak (12,713'), Flattop Mountain (12,324'), Otis Peak (12,486') and Thatchtop (12,668') to the east, glimpses of Longs Peak (14,259') and Storm Peak (13,326') to the south, and sweeping views of the distant Mummy Range to the north. These water-lined meadows are also good places to find wildlife activity, particularly elk and deer. The trails makes consecutive stream crossings to Boulder Brook Backcountry Campsites #2 and #1 (2.05 miles and 2.15 miles, respectively). The trail ends rather unceremoniously at its intersection with the North Longs Peak Trail (2.4 miles : 10.311'). A few steps along it to the west is a bridge spanning an attractive section of the brook, a good place to rest before retracing your steps back to the trailhead.",112.133333333
243,Long Meadows,rocky-mountain-national-park,7.6,9042,10452,1410,3,False,"Long Meadows is accessible from the Timber Creek Trailhead on the west side of Rocky Mountain National Park. The Timber Lake Trail joins the unmaintained Long Meadows Trail to reach the meadows' northern edge.  Two contiguous miles make it the longest and most isolated meadow system in the Park's interior mountains. This food-rich ecosystem attracts deer, elk, moose, and bear in great numbers. Visitors will enjoy certain solitude, excellent wildlife viewing, and miles of open space to explore: The Timber Lake Trail curls south through an aspen-lodgepole forest highlighted by arnica, kinnickinnick, columbine, and fallen timber. It rises steadily across a steep N-S hillside to a stream that feeds the Colorado River (.65 miles : 9,108'). Gaps in the forest offer partial views of the Never Summer Range (west). The trail keeps a steady S-SE heading to the Timber Creek backcountry campsite (3.05 miles : 10,185'), and bends east to meet Timber Creek at the Long Meadows Trail split (3.25 miles : 10,225'). The Long Meadows Trail turns south and undulates beneath notably tall columns of spruce and fir. Despite its unmaintained classification and some negotiable deadfall, the trail is actually quite easy to follow. The path fades and grades level on the north edge of Long Meadows (3.8 miles : 10,452'). Here cross-country travel begins in the meadow, or along its east fringe. This fungible, sloping meadow draws moisture into a thin but deep stream that oxbows down the valley center. Long Meadows run nearly two miles south and downhill to another unimproved trail that connects the south end with the Onahu Creek Trail (see map). Patience and map skills are necessary to pick up this unimproved trail. While x-country travel in the open meadow is easy, navigation is appreciably difficult in the adjacent forest. It's important to mark your entry-exit point to the meadow before venturing off the unmaintained trail, as it can be difficult to find on the return.",141.266666667
244,Timber Lake,rocky-mountain-national-park,9.6,9042,11085,2043,3,False,"Timber Lake is located 4.8 miles from Timber Creek Trailhead on the west side of Rocky Mountain National Park. It shares a large, level basin with two adjacent ponds beneath Mt Ida (12,889'). A well-cut trail leads through diverse forests and long meadows frequented by moose and elk. Visitors will enjoy excellent fishing and room to explore this open alpine setting: The Timber Lake Trail curls south through an aspen-lodgepole forest accented by arnica, kinnickinnick, columbine and fallen trees. It rises steadily across a steep N-S hillside to a stream that feeds the Colorado River (.65 miles : 9,108'). Gaps in the forest offer partial views of the Never Summer Range (west). Spruce and fir soon emerge (2.0 miles : 9,925') on a steady S-SE climb to the Timber Creek backcountry campsite spur (3.05 miles : 10,185'). The trail briefly meets Timber Creek at the Long Meadows Trail split (3.25 miles : 10,225'), but quickly veers northeast on steep switchbacks into a heavy subalpine forest. Grades moderate through a clearing to the first Jack Straw backcountry campsite on the edge of a notably large meadow below Jack Straw Mountain (4.1 miles : 10,798'). The trail levels by the second Jack Straw site (4.25 miles : 10,825') and shifts quickly in a thinning, rugged forest to the Rockslide (4.55 miles : 10,926') and Snowbird (4.65 miles : 11,015') backcountry campsites. It clears treeline on the NW corner of Timber Lake (4.8 miles : 11,085'). The basin and adjacent ponds are generally obstacle-free and easy to explore. Wildflowers are particularly abundant in these damp, sunny banks. An informal route continues up the lake's east shore to Mt Ida. Look for bighorn sheep on slopes over the lake. Those with time should consider a cross-country detour into Long Meadows, which are among the largest in the Park.",141.266666667
245,Twin Sisters,rocky-mountain-national-park,7.0,9040,11428,2388,4,False,"The Twin Sisters ridge runs nearly two miles along the east-central boundary of Rocky Mountain National Park. A short but strenuous trail leads to a small saddle, and splits up scrambling routes to each summit (11,413' and 11,428').  A landslide caused by the 2013 floods wiped out a portion of trail between 1.3 and 1.65 miles. While terrestrial damage is extensive, only this short segment was actually affected, and has since been re-routed across and up the far side of the slide. The re-route is steep with deadfall in places, but sufficiently marked by cairns (though snow and mud can present greater challenges). Call ahead for trail conditions, especially in winter and during the thaw. Visitors will enjoy rangy panoramas across Longs Peak, Estes Park and the Continental Divide, along with interesting alpine ecology leading to the summits: The trail heads south on a steady climb across a west-facing slope through uniform lodgepole. Longs Peak (14,259'), Mt Meeker (13,911'), Mount Lady Washington (13,281'), Powell Peak (13,208') and Estes Cone (11,006') emerge through gaps in the forest at 1.0 miles (9,780'). Look for Mills Glacier in Mills Moraine, a gash in the landscape at the base of Longs Peak's east-facing 'diamond'. Mills Glacier forms the headwaters of Chasm Lake and Roaring Fork Creek. Timber breaks suddenly on the edge of the landslide with a good look at its entire path (1.3 miles : 9,840'). Cairns lead across the slide and turn sharply up newly-created switchbacks on the far (south) side. Sections may be obscured by deadfall and runoff channels, but are generally easy to follow. Travel normalizes on the original trail past 1.65 miles, resuming a steady climb on switchbacks across the National Park Boundary into stands of limber pine and bristlecone pine (2.25 miles : 10,650'). These high-alpine trees are specially adapted to poor soil and harsh growing conditions found on this wind-buffeted mountain. The trail clears treeline (2.9 miles : 11,040') and winds across an exposed talus slope up to a small saddle between the Twin Sisters (3.35 miles : 11,348'). A clear path breaks right above a research facility to the West Summit (3.45 miles : 11,413'), and a vague route leads left on a more challenging scramble to the East Summit (3.5 miles : 11,428'). Exercise caution on these sharp and potentially unstable rocks, especially in windy conditions.",96.8666666667
246,Beaver Mountain Loop,rocky-mountain-national-park,5.1,8440,8440,777,3,False,"Beaver Mountain (10,491') is located in the east central quadrant of Rocky Mountain National Park. The Beaver Mountain Trail loops through meadows, ponderosa parks and aspen-fir forests in a uniquely diverse life zone.  Low elevations and mild grades make it accessible year-round, an ideal choice for families, runners, and winter recreation. A high water table under Beaver Meadows creates fine, moist soil conditions that do not effectively support tree growth. These meadow-creating conditions are perpetuated over time by grazing wildlife and natural fires. Surrounding slopes, where soil conditions improve, support ponderosa woodlands, aspen, fir and lodgepole pine. This rich mosaic of meadow and forest provides ideal habitat, safe passage, and abundant food for elk, deer, bear, mountain lion, badger, fox and coyote. The following description travels clockwise on the Beaver Mountain Loop: The trail splits just a few steps from the trailhead to form a short loop within the loop. The forks are equidistant and rejoin at a sign for Trail Ridge Road - Ute Meadow Campsite (.6 miles : 8,568'). Curiously, the Beaver Mountain Trail is not listed on these signs, but heading for Trail Ridge Road will keep you on track in each instance. The Beaver Mountain Trail leaves open meadow and climbs into a mixed pine-fir forest. It wraps around a large outcrop (1.3 miles), crosses a stream, and heads SW up a narrow gulch to the Ute Trail split (1.65 miles : 9,025'). The low rise to your left is the top of a divisive moraine between Moraine Park (south) and Beaver Meadows (north). Moraines are ridges of glacial till pushed aside by a glacier's downward movement. Scale this ridge for good views over Moraine Park and the Cub Creek drainage. The Beaver Mountain Trail continues steadily up the east shoulder of Beaver Mountain. It crests on the loop's highest point (2.2 miles : 9,217') and drops to a hitch rack (2.3 miles : 9,120'). The trail continues downhill through uniform lodgepole to a bridge over Beaver Brook (3.15 miles : 8,715'). Once over it skirts a slender, aspen-studded meadow ideal for seeing wildlife. The trail crosses another stream and climbs into a pine forest, which transitions back to ponderosa park and open meadow at a sign for Deer Ridge Junction (4.6 miles : 8,532'). Turn right toward Beaver Meadows. The trail drops gently through a sprawling swath of sage-grass meadow back to Upper Beaver Meadows Trailhead to complete the loop (5.1 miles : 8,440').",107.433333333
247,Moraine Park Trail,rocky-mountain-national-park,3.4,8440,8080,-360,1,False,"The Moraine Park Trail connects Upper Beaver Meadows with Fern Lake Road near the Beaver Meadow Entrance Station of Rocky Mountain National Park. A high water table under Beaver Meadows creates fine, moist soil conditions that do not effectively support tree growth. These meadow-creating conditions are perpetuated over time by grazing wildlife and natural fires. Surrounding slopes, where soil conditions improve, support ponderosa woodlands, aspen, fir and lodgepole pine. This rich mosaic provides ideal habitat, safe passage, and abundant food for elk, deer, bear, mountain lion, badger, fox, and coyote. The Moraine Park Trail is ideal for families, winter recreation, and those with limited time or abilities. Visitors will enjoy excellent views of Longs Peak, large meadows, aspen groves, and a good chance to see elk: The trail heads south through a flat, broad meadow for .3 miles to the first of several small ridges. The trail dips and rolls gently through sparse forests and open rocky areas to the north edge of Moraine Meadows. The trail drops more rapidly to the Moraine Park Campground (.8 miles).  It's important to note here that this 'main' trail is bisected and paralleled at times by several unnamed trails that form small figure eights through the immediate area, especially in the Moraine Park Campground vicinity.  While having a good map will make staying on the correct trail easier, the absence of trail signs may cause temporary confusion.  Continuing south with the Campground on your left should serve as an adequate bearing. The trail ends unceremoniously at the Livery on the Fern Lake access road. Extend this hike by continuing on to the Cub Lake Trailhead, with access to Cub Lake and the South Lateral Moraine Trail.",107.433333333
248,Ute Trail,rocky-mountain-national-park,13.0,8440,11465,3025,5,False,"The Ute Trail connects the Beaver Mountain Trail with Trail Ridge Road in Rocky Mountain National Park. It follows a SE-NW route from Beaver Meadows to summer hunting grounds in the tundra used by prehistoric tribes, Utes and Arapahos for thousands of years.  This lightly used trail passes through an exceptionally diverse landscape highlighted by large meadows, mixed forests, rich wildlife, and open tundra. The Ute Trail is strenuous with sparingly marked segments on the climb through Windy Gulch into the tundra. Anticipate rugged terrain and a range of weather conditions along the way, and plan travel time and resources accordingly. Hikers will enjoy solitude, excellent wildlife viewing and extended travel in open tundra on the Ute Trail: The trail splits just a few steps from the Beaver Meadows Trailhead; the forks are virtually equidistant and rejoin at a sign for Trail Ridge Road - Ute Meadow Campsite .6 miles ahead (8,568'). Distances below follow the left fork through Beaver Meadows to this sign. The Beaver Mountain Trail soon leaves the meadow and climbs into a mixed pine-fir forest. It wraps around a large outcrop (1.3 miles), crosses a stream, and heads SW up a narrow gulch to the Ute Trail split (1.65 miles : 9,025'). The low rise to your left is the top of a moraine between Moraine Park (s) and Beaver Meadows (n). Moraines are ridges of glacial till pushed aside by glacial movements. Scale the ridge for views across Moraine Park before pressing on. The Ute Trail rises on a narrow and rugged path that clings to a steep valley wall over the Big Thompson River. The trail undulates to a crest (2.15 miles : 9,169'), then drops beside a trickle that is Windy Gulch Creek. It gradually levels into a healthier forest and skirts the edge of lower Ute Meadows, a damp, tall grass complex ideal for seeing fox, coyote, elk, deer, bear, and even mountain lion (2.35 miles : 9,245'). The trail steepens back into a thinly treed forest to the Ute Meadows Backcountry Campsite (2.9 miles : 9,423'). The forest breaks here on the edge of upper Ute Meadows with a good look up Windy Gulch. The meadow is wide, cluttered, dry, and dotted with a handful of aspen. Note the introduction of white pine, a hardy conifer =not typically found at these elevations in the Park. Their presence is indicative of the harsh conditions and poor soil beds of Windy Gulch. The trail heads northwest on a clear, moderate grade back into the forest (3.35 miles : 9,745') that quickly grows prohibitively steep and ill-defined on a twisting, oft-obstructed track. Cairns provide some guidance, but are difficult to find and follow. Note that you'll gain nearly 780' in just .4 miles upon re-entering the forest (3.75 miles : 10,205'). In the likely event you feel off -course, follow natural contours of the land and steer yourself into the center of the gulch. The trail is quite easy to find once above treeline, and the heading intuitively followed to the top of Windy Gulch at Timberline Pass (4.5 miles : 11,495'). Here the trail levels abruptly in the wide open tundra with well-earned views back across Windy Gulch and the southeast quadrant of Rocky Mountain National Park. A wide, flat path continues northwest along Tombstone Ridge with sweeping views across miles of open tundra and Forest Canyon to the west. Look for elk, bighorn sheep, and mountain goat as you progress.

The Ute Trail loosely follows a route used by indigenous people to connect low meadows in the east with elk and sheep hunting grounds in the alpine tundra.  While the entire Ute Trail stretches nearly 5 strenuous miles from Beaver Meadows to Trail Ridge Road, visitors can enjoy a considerably milder section - and arguably its most dramatic - by starting in open tundra on Trail Ridge Road and walking 2 miles along Tombstone Ridge to Timberline Pass. Visitors will enjoy alpine landscapes and good wildlife viewing along these high points of the Ute Trail: The Ute Trail drops into open tundra with good views across Forest Canyon, carved deep by the Big Thompson River below. Terra Toma Mountain (12,718'), Hayden Spire, Sprague Mountain (12,713'), and Stones Peak (12,922') cap the west canyon wall. Look for elk, sheep, mountain goat, marmot, and ptarmigan along the tundra's broad, open slopes as you progress. The trail rises back up Tombstone Ridge to a crest (1.5 miles : 11,656'), and glides gently to a sudden drop off at Timberline Pass (2.0 miles : 11,495').

This shallow, upper-montane lake sees slightly less traffic than other Wild Basin destinations, making it a good choice during peak summer months. Visitors will enjoy tranquil forests with good fishing and backcountry camping options at Finch Lake:  The trail initially heads east and climbs 470' in just .8 miles to a sharp hairpin turn, where it bends southwest and levels across grassy aspen - ponderosa hillsides. Well-spaced trees create good viewing lanes for wildlife on this mild stretch. The trail continues steadily past connections for Allenspark Trailhead-access (1.4 miles : 8,974') and Calypso Falls (2.35 miles : 9,520'). Gaps in the forest offer good views up Wild Basin valley toward Mount Copeland (13,176') and Ouzel Peak (12,716'). The trail steepens to a large break where lightning-induced fire struck in 1978 (2.55 miles : 9,740'). Despite ostensible damage, forests require periodic fire to thin timber, create space for new growth, and replenish soils. The trail re-enters a dense spruce-fir forest and shifts frequently to a footbridge (3.85 miles : 10,072'). Small streams, Spanish Beard and verdant ground cover accent this peaceful area. Variously level and rugged travel resumes to a crest and sharp right turn down winding switchbacks (3.95 miles : 10,069'). Fringe season travelers should anticipate this turn, as snow may conceal it well into June and again by October. The trail winds steeply down for .2 miles and levels in thick timber on the east side of Finch Lake (4.35 miles), then wraps to the north shore where distance measurements are taken (4.6 miles : 9,912').

The trail hugs the lake past backcountry campsites and drops across Coney Creek (4.65 miles : 9,905'). It continues on variously steep grades up the north side of a widening valley. Small clearings and ponds to the south are good places to find wildlife, including moose by late summer. The trail crosses Pear Creek to the Pear Creek backcountry campsite (6.1 miles : 10,437'), past which the forest thins on the final approach to Pear Lake (6.5 miles : 10,582'). The maintained trail ends on a ridge over Pear Lake, where a spur splits north to backcountry campsites, and a social trail drops around the south shore with views of Mount Copeland and Ogallala Peak (13,138'). The Hutcheson Lakes and Cony Lake (11,512') are accessible via social trails and intuitive routing up the drainage.",93.7
252,Sandbeach Lake,rocky-mountain-national-park,8.8,8312,10283,1971,3,False,"Sandbeach Lake (10,283') is located 4.4 miles from the Wild Basin Entrance Station in Rocky Mountain National Park. It's one of the Park's deepest lakes at nearly 50', and aptly named for its wide, sandy shore. Sandbeach Lake is ringed by gnarled bristlecone pine in a broad flat free of confining valley walls, and its open perimeter gives the area a uniquely spacious feel. In 1988 the Park removed earth dams on the lake's outlet, replacing it with willow and brush to create spawning habitat for greenback cutthroat trout. A small but stable breeding population exists today. Good fishing and a beach-like setting make this a desirable overnight destination. The basin is susceptible to strong winds and cooler temperatures, as the presence of bristlecone pine might suggest. Aspen and leafy ground cover line much of the trail, and produce brilliant fall colors: The trail rises quickly over North St Vrain Creek through ponderosa, lodgepole and aspen to the Meeker Park Trail split (1.35 miles : 8,990'). Below to the north is Copeland Moraine - take a few steps along the Meeker Park Trail for a closer look. The trail continues west on a mild but rocky grade lined by aspen and thick ground cover. Campers Creek is occasionally audible but seldom visible as you pass spurs for the Hole-in-the-Wall and Campers Creek backcountry campsites (1.88 miles : 9,172' and 2.1 miles : 9,265', respectively). The rugged trail crosses a small creek (2.55 miles : 9,543') and continues steeply to the Beaver Mill backcountry campsite (3.0 miles : 9,680'). It levels momentarily near the Hunters Creek backcountry campsite (3.25 miles : 9,746'), crosses Hunters Creek (3.5 miles : 9,840') on a footbridge and begins a rocky, 443' climb to the north shore of Sandbeach Lake (4.4 miles : 10,283'). Social trails follow Sandbeach Lake's open east shore, with terrific views of Mt Meeker (13,911') and easy lake access. Bristlecone pine ring the lake, which are fairly uncommon at these elevations in this part of the Park. Poor soil and blustery winds across the flat, open basin create hostile growing conditions similar to higher alpine environments where they're typically found.",88.8
253,Bluebird Lake,rocky-mountain-national-park,12.6,8500,10978,2478,5,False,"Bluebird Lake (10,978') is located 6.3 miles from Wild Basin Trailhead in Rocky Mountain National Park. It occupies a large, rocky bowl above treeline just east of the Continental Divide. The trail follows North St Vrain Creek and Ouzel Creek through diverse forests and an interesting burn-recovery area into the upper valley. A steep push leads through treeline to the lake, where an unmaintained route continues along the inlet to its headwaters at Pipit Lake. Visitors will enjoy varied terrain, several waterfalls, access to Ouzel Lake and excellent fishing on the hike to Bluebird Lake: The trail rises gently beside North St Vrain Creek to spurs for Lower and Upper Copeland Falls (.35 and .45 miles). Mild travel continues to the backcountry campsite access trail (1.35 miles : 8,860'), crosses the creek and climbs .45 miles to Calypso Cascades (1.8 miles : 9,108'). The trail wraps up a north-facing valley wall and passes through an area touched by lightning-induced fire in 1978 (2.1 miles : 9,100'). Despite significant damage, the forest is in a natural state of recovery. Grasses and young aspen fill newly opened spaces, and in time spruce and fir will return and restore the forest to its ecological climax. The trail steepens to Ouzel Falls (2.6 miles : 9,366'), drops and rises back to the Ouzel Lake - Thunder Lake Trail split (2.95 miles : 9,418'). Bear left for a short, moderately steep climb to a divisive E-W ridge between the Ouzel Creek drainage (south) and North St Vrain Creek drainage (north). The trail bends west through the heart of the 1978 Ouzel Fire zone with rangy views through a culled forest: Pilot Mountain (12,222'), Mount Alice (13,310'), Mt Meeker (13,911) and Longs Peak (14,259') are visible to the northwest, while Mount Copeland's (13,176') north flank looms over the Ouzel drainage to the southwest. The trail undulates along the exposed ridge to the Ouzel Lake spur (4.5 miles : 10,026'), and continues on a more rugged path into an unaffected swath of forest (5.2 miles : 10,175'). It rises quickly through an attractive composite of mature spruce, glades, wildflowers and streams to the Upper Ouzel Creek Backcountry Campsite (5.9 miles : 10,602'). Here the forest thins at the base of a steep climb beside Bluebird Lake's outlet stream. The trail negotiates rocks slabs and talus through treeline on the final approach; look for cairns or simply follow the stream if concealed by snow. The trail crests a few dozen yards over Bluebird Lake and scrambles down to the shore (6.3 miles : 10,978'). Ouzel Peak (12,716') rises prominently from the lake's west shore, with Mount Copeland's north flank and Mahana Peak's (12,632') southeast flank completing the cirque wall. An unmarked and unmaintained route follows Bluebird Lake's inlet west to Lark Pond and Pipit Lake, while another cross-country route leads southwest to Junco Lake.",94.7
254,Calypso Cascades and Ouzel Falls,rocky-mountain-national-park,5.4,8500,9366,866,2,False,"Ouzel Falls drop 40' through a narrow chute and flow under a long bridge spanning Ouzel Creek. Ouzel Creek continues a short distance to a dramatic convergence with North St Vrain Creek, the Wild Basin Area's primary drainage.  While the falls are impressive, the lively riparian corridor through which you'll pass is equally compelling. Visitors will enjoy moderate grades and miles of stream access for angling and exploration. Crowds build quickly, so an early arrival is recommended: The trail rises gently beside North St Vrain Creek to spurs for Lower and Upper Copeland Falls (.35 and .45 miles). Mild travel continues to the backcountry campsite access trail (1.35 miles : 8,860'), crosses the creek and climbs .45 miles to Calypso Cascades (1.8 miles : 9,108'). Calypso Cascades - powered by Cony Creek - fan out across a steep granite cliff. It flows under two long bridges above the confluence with North St Vrain Creek. The trail winds past Calypso Cascades up a north-facing valley wall, passing for a short time through an area stricken by the 1978 Ouzel Fire (2.0 miles : 9,100'). Grasses and wildflowers brighten these once charred hillsides, while young aspen and pine emerge in replenished soils. Downed trees open the forest to sweeping views of Mt Meeker, Longs Peak and the northern Wild Basin Area. A moderate climb through lodgepole, spruce, and fir leads to Ouzel Falls (2.7 miles : 9,366') and a lengthy bridge across its turbulent base. Social trails leads from either side of the bridge to closer views of the falls, but climbing the falls is strongly discouraged, as the terrain is uneven and deceptively slick. Exercise caution when scrambling, and maintain a safe distance from moving water. Those with time may consider continuing to Ouzel Lake or Bluebird Lake, 2.25 miles and 3.65 miles up from the falls, respectively.",94.7

They occupy a tiered alpine basin framed by Pilot Mountain (12,222'), Mount Alice (13,310') and the north ridge of Mt Orton (11,724'). A maintained trail leads 6.85 miles to Lion Lake #1, past which an intuitively followed cross-country route continues up Trio Falls to Lion Lake #2 and Snowbank Lake. Visitors will enjoy good backcountry camping and some of the finest alpine landscapes in the Park: The trail rises beside North St Vrain Creek to spurs for Lower and Upper Copeland Falls (.35 and .45 miles). It reaches the backcountry campsite access trail split (1.35 miles : 8,860'), crosses the creek and climbs .45 miles to Calypso Cascades (1.8 miles : 9,108'). The trail wraps up a north-facing valley wall and passes through an area stricken by lightning-induced fire in 1978 (2.1 miles : 9,100'). Despite significant damage, the forest is in a natural state of recovery. Grasses and wildflowers fill the hillsides, while young aspen and lodgepole emerge in replenished soils. In time, spruce and fir will succeed them and return the forest to its ecological climax. The trail steepens to Ouzel Falls (2.6 miles : 9,366'), drops and rises back to the Ouzel Lake - Thunder Lake Trail split (2.95 miles : 9,418'). Follow signs for Thunder Lake. The trail undulates higher and crosses back over the creek to its 2nd connection with the backcountry campsite access trail (3.35 miles : 9,505'). Here it steadies on a NW heading for 1.4 miles to the Thunder Lake - Lion Lake Trail split (4.7 miles : 10,025'). Make good time on this pleasant but unspectacular stretch to allow more time for difficult segments ahead. The Lion Lake Trail splits NW and climbs 565' in just .85 miles on a shifting and potentially faint or obstructed path. Kinnikinnick carpets the forest floor between large boulders and pockets of spruce, and a number of ponds hidden just off trail are good places to see wildlife. Grades moderate through 6.0 miles (10,690') and level in a clearing at 6.5 miles (11,083'). The trail emerges in open space with views of Mt Orton's north ridge, and skirts the edge of two large ponds (6.6 miles : 11,090') to a crest over Lion Lake #1 (6.7 miles : 11,125'). The trail may lose clarity in this oft-damp area, but is intuitively followed up the east side of the valley. Lion Lake #1 (6.85 miles : 11,075') occupies an idyllic alpine basin ringed by large, level meadows and several outlying ponds. The lake basin is open and easy to explore. Head south for terrific views across the lake of Pilot Mountain, Mount Alice, and Mt Orton, or north to its braided, flower-lined inlet area. Hiking to Lion Lake #2 and Snowbank Lake (see map)Follow the maintained trail to Lion Lake #1's inlet, and cross where you're able. Look for cairns running up the west side of the inlet and follow them to the base of Trio Falls. Keep west of the stream, proceed cautiously over snowfields, and steer clear of cornices. You'll scale a steep wall beside the falls and cross a small confluence just below the SW corner of Lion Lake #2 (7.25 miles : 11,260'). Break off your route and punch through tangles of willow and krummholz to reach the lake's south shore (7.35 miles : 11,413'), or simply continue up beside it. A pronounced cornice hangs off the lake's north side much of the year. The route - now passing through open alpine tundra - keeps north to a second steep wall, which you'll scale to a crest overlooking Snowbank Lake. Drop to Snowbank Lake's west shore (7.7 miles : 11,523'), and scramble out into the middle of the lake on a natural jetty.",94.7

The spur turns south and crosses the valley on a variously faint and uneven path to Ouzel Lake (4.95 miles : 10,010'). Bluebird Lake is a challenging 1.9 miles and 968' climb from the Ouzel Lake spur (see related trail link above). Trail conditions are more rugged and may be obscured by snow and runoff well into summer. Call ahead for conditions.

258,Beaver Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,5.2,8355,9746,1391,3,True,"Beaver Lake is located 2.6 miles from Beaver Lake Trailhead in the Beaver Creek Ski Resort (see Directions below for important trailhead access and distance details). The lake is flanked by steep walls to the west, and meadows to the north and east ideal for camping and picnicking. Thick timber crowds much of the shore, however anglers with waders will find ample access and excellent fishing.  The Beaver Lake Trail follows a graded service road much of the way, offering 3-4 season utility for hikers, runners, snow shoeing and skiing: The trail begins at the top of Village Road in the Beaver Creek Ski Resort. Scale a grassy knoll and merge onto a service road, which rises past several maintenance facilities and ski-runs. Despite these unconventional surroundings, much of the road-trail is actually tucked between Beaver Creek and thick, flower-studded aspen groves. The Beaver Lake Trail passes connections for Allie's Way (.75 miles) and the Village-to-Village Trail (.9 miles) up to a bridge over Beaver Creek (1.55 miles : 9,165'). It resumes a deceptively steep pace through airy slopes to the Holy Cross Wilderness Boundary (2.4 miles : 9,660'), where grades moderate on singletrack into open meadows on the edge of Beaver Lake (2.6 miles : 9,746'). There are only a few easy access points from this spot and they tend to be congested, so use social trails or continue on the main trail and improvise a path down to more secluded areas. A short hike past Beaver Lake soon levels in a notably pristine, stream-crossed forest that's well-worth exploring.",115.966666667
259,Turquoise Lakes,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,14.4,8355,11308,2953,4,True,"The Turquoise Lakes are located 6.65 and 7.2 miles from Beaver Lake Trailhead in the Holy Cross Wilderness. The lakes form the headwaters of Beaver Creek, a major tributary of the Eagle River. Lower Turquoise Lake fills a large, level basin surrounded by rolling meadows, and Upper Turquoise Lake is located .6 miles and 210' up in a secluded bowl just below the valley headwall. Lower Turquoise Lake features ideal camping and fishing terrain along its open perimeter. The upper lake is a relatively quick excursion to a more rugged but equally compelling setting. Two trails access the Turquoise Lakes: the Beaver Lake Trail which begins in the Beaver Creek Ski Resort, and the West Grouse Creek Trail from Grouse Creek Trailhead on Highway 24. The following description begins at Beaver Creek, preferable for long stretches of mild grades and pristine forests along the water (see Worth Noting below for important trailhead access and distance information): The Beaver Lake Trail begins at the top of Village Road in the Beaver Creek Ski Resort. Scale a grassy knoll and merge onto a service road, which rises past several maintenance facilities and ski-runs. It passes connections for Allie's Way and the Village-to-Village Trail up to a bridge over Beaver Creek (1.55 miles : 9,165'). It keeps a steady pace through airy slopes to the Holy Cross Wilderness Boundary (2.4 miles : 9,660'), where it narrows on singletrack to the edge of Beaver Lake (2.6 miles : 9,746'). The trail continues past Beaver Lake and moderates on a long, pleasant stretch highlighted by mild grades, braided streams, verdant ground cover and hanging moss. There's little beetle-kill and minimal deadfall in this notably healthy spruce-fir forest. Travel is quick up to a sturdy footbridge that crosses (west) over a cascading section of Beaver Creek (4.7 miles : 10,355'). It's easy to miss, but a fading trail on the water's edge will lead your eyes to it. Once over, the trail skirts the base of a talus slope and levels back into heavy forest. It reaches a double-bridge crossing back to the east side of the creek at 5.45 miles (10,595'), past which it runs up the side of a long, open meadow. Take a few steps off-trail to scan for wildlife. The trail shifts quickly and grows faint while transitioning through the subalpine. Thinning timber reveals expansive meadows on either side of Beaver Creek leading to the Grouse Mountain (West Grouse Creek) trail split (6.6 miles : 11,075'). Here the trail temporarily disappears, but is intuitively followed through a marshy flat to the NE corner of Lower Turquoise Lake (6.65 miles : 11,095'). The basin is broad and level with little distinction between the lake and terra firma in some places. The shoreline is obstacle free (save a few bands of willow), and easy to explore. The Upper Turquoise Lake Trail is located across the outlet stream, a few steps past the Grouse Mt Trail split. A small log spans the creek but is fairly anonymous; to pick up the trail, simply cross the creek and it will soon appear. The trail leads around the lake across damp meadows and low rises with drier conditions for camping. It curls SW and rises gently through pockets of spruce to the edge of Upper Turquoise Lake (7.2 miles : 11,308'). The lake is hemmed by the steep valley headwall and some rugged terrain, but easy enough to maneuver about. You'll find secluded nooks to camp, but open space around the lower lake is arguably more conducive.",115.966666667

It's among the newest renovations in the 10th Mountain Division Hut System, which manages 34 backcountry huts across Colorado. Second Creek Basin receives about 500"" of snow each year - no secret to backcountry skiers - but the re-opening of Broome Hut is sure to increase summer traffic as word spreads. The trail climbs 700' in just one mile from Highway 40 to the hut, which overlooks an idyllic alpine basin (1.0 mile : 11,243'). It continues west another half mile through treeline before ending abruptly on the edge of open tundra (1.55 miles : 11,611'). Note this cairn-marked point (GPS point #5), which may be hidden by willow mats and hard to find. Cross-country travel begins here with a short, steep climb to the Mount Nystrom Trail (2.1 miles : 11,925'). It's an approximate point, as the Mount Nystrom Trail is only marked by cairns and posts spread across long distances in open tundra. The tundra is uncommonly broad and level here - it almost feels like Kansas, only at 12,000' with mountains on every horizon. Views include the Vasquez Peaks (west), Winter Park and Rocky Mountain (north), and Mt Flora (east). Elk, bighorn sheep and mountain goat are drawn to these well-developed alpine grasses, and if they're anywhere in the area, you'll see them. Alpine flowers are abundant, peaking by mid-July. Tread lightly in this delicate ecosystem, and note that dogs must be leashed once across the Vasquez Peak Wilderness boundary.

It stands high over Ethel Lake and the Mad Creek drainage with exceptional views in all directions.  Moderate grades make Mt Flora among the most accessible 13ers in the Winter Park area. The CDT continues on to a saddle below Breckenridge Peak (12,889'), an easy off trail scramble. Visitors will enjoy miles of airy alpine travel and diverse tundra ecology on the hike to Mt Flora and Breckenridge Peak: The trail begins on a service road that winds steeply over Berthoud Pass in a thinning forest. Look for signs of lynx, which have been documented in this area. At .85 miles (11,675') the CDT splits left off the road and narrows on single track through treeline. It moderates on a NE heading across broad, verdant slopes with well-developed grasses and forbs that attract elk, bighorn sheep and mountain goat. The trail rises steadily through 12,000' (1.3 miles) to a saddle below Colorado Mines Peak (12,493'), and good views down the Blue Creek drainage (1.6 miles : 12,157'). It levels across the saddle before climbing steeply up the far side (1.95 miles : 12,365'). Travel eases to a false summit (2.35 miles : 12,723') and levels again for half a mile above the Mad Creek drainage. Cushion and mat plants cover the area, primary tundra constituents that help build soil beds by trapping organic debris. Over time, grasses and forbs will take hold in deeper soils to form plots of tundra turf. Also note the ubiquitous big root spring beauty plant, whose taproot can reach 6' deep. The trail pitches up at 2.85 miles (12,880') on the final push to Mt Flora (3.22 miles : 13,132'). A tall cairn marks the summit, a large flat area with several rock wind shelters. Maneuver about to see Ethel Lake (north), which boasts a brilliant turquois hue. The CDT continues down the east side of Mt Flora toward Breckenridge Peak. It's initially faint but clarifies across the broad connecting saddle (3.9 miles : 12,748'). The CDT doesn't scale Breckenridge Peak, but the summit is fairly obvious (it's the highest point on your heading before tilting down hill). Find a good line for the short climb to the top (4.1 miles : 12,889'). Breckenridge Peak adds approximately 1.8 miles and 550' total elevation gain to the roundtrip hike.",64.1833333333
262,Stanley Mountain,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,7.7,11307,12521,1214,3,True,"Stanley Mountain is located 3.85 miles west of Berthoud Pass along the Continental Divide Trail. This airy alpine trek climbs steeply through treeline then levels in open tundra for two miles to the summit. Good trail conditions and mild grades are ideal for families, an acclimation hike and winter travel. Views are exceptional throughout, highlighted by Vasquez Peak and the Mt Flora massif. Visitors will also enjoy diverse alpine ecology and wildlife on the hike to Stanley Mountain: From Berthoud Pass, cross HWY 40 to the braided trail on the west side of the road. Choose the well-defined track that cuts SW across the hillside and ignore social trails heading straight up. The trail rises steadily in a healthy subalpine forest with emerging views to the east. Look for grouse and snowshoe hare in this prime habitat. It clears treeline (.85 miles : 11,850') and levels on a high, thin ridge to the base of a steep wall (1.25 miles : 11,930'). Strenuous switchbacks reach open tundra (1.55 miles : 12,253') where travel eases up another ridge to the Vasquez Peak Wilderness Boundary (1.85 miles : 12,370'). Here the trail bends SW and moderates atop the Divide, undulating subtly over three distinct basins which can be cumulatively taxing at these elevations. As with many segments of the CDT in Colorado the east side drops precipitously, while the west slopes gently down. Glass untracked basins below for elk and moose on this fast-moving stretch. The trail rises up the south side of a third basin (3.5 miles : 12,370') with your first glimpse of Stanley Mountain, a nondescript rock pile just off trail. It runs just below the unmarked summit with a very short scramble to the top (3.85 miles : 12,521'). This unassuming nub is easy to miss, but a decisive drop just past it is a reliable indicator. Vasquez Peak (12,947') stands prominently to the west, accessible off the CDT on a sparingly defined but intuitively followed route. This is a challenging extension that should only be attempted by experienced hikers under favorable weather conditions.",64.1833333333
263,Booth Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,8.7,8422,11434,3012,5,True,"Booth Lake is located 4.35 miles from Booth Lake Trailhead on I-70 in Vail CO. It fills a slender basin at the head of a steep walled valley in the Eagles Nest Wilderness. The Booth Creek Trail is a compelling destination in itself, highlighted by Booth Falls, mature aspen, abundant flowers and long alpine meadows en route to the lake: The trail winds north through grassy hillsides to the Eagles Nest Wilderness Boundary, and gradually straightens up a widening valley framed by towering, red-hued walls. Grades moderate from 1.0 - 1.5 miles through a colorful mix of aspen, leafy ground cover and berries. The trail grows rugged leading up to Booth Falls (1.9 miles : 9,720'), which drop 60' in several stages (visible and accessible from numerous spurs off the main trail). The trail continues steeply over the falls where aspen give way to a thick spruce forest. It drops and levels briefly along Booth Creek, a useful reprieve before another strenuous push breaks treeline (2.5 miles : 10,165') and crests at the foot of a long, narrow valley (2.85 miles : 10,490'). The valley floor and slopes above are thinly wooded, a good place to find wildlife and clear camping terrain. The valley bends northwest on a mild grade beneath craggy, talus strewn walls. Behind you are emerging views of the Holy Cross range and portions of the Vail ski area. The trail moves quickly up-valley through open meadow and thin bands of spruce to the base of a final, steep climb (3.95 miles : 11,120'). The trail twists quickly and unevenly through large rock slabs and boulders to a crest, where it drops to the grassy east shore of Booth Lake (4.35 miles : 11,434'). Booth Lake is deceptively long with a small island in its center. The lake is easy to explore, as are the open slopes above. A low ridge on the south shore has a particularly good view across the basin, and back down valley on the route you took to reach it.",97.05
264,Buffalo Mountain,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,5.5,9774,12777,3003,5,True,"Buffalo Mountain is located in the Eagles Nest Wilderness, a prominent summit over Silverthorne CO with commanding views across South Willow Creek basin, Salt Lick Gulch, Red Peak, Eccles Pass, Red Buffalo Pass and the Gore and Ten Mile ranges.  The Buffalo Mountain Trail is fairly short but strenuous, gaining over 3000' in just 2.75 miles. Portions of the trail negotiate steep switchbacks and rugged talus fields above treeline, which require careful time management and equal exertion on the descent. Start early for a comfortable pace, and extra time to explore the large summit. Visitors will enjoy long stretches of open tundra, and a good chance to see mountain goat in prime habitat: The trail heads northwest on a moderate grade past the Eagles Nest Wilderness Boundary (.35 miles : 9,974') to the Buffalo Mountain Trail - South Willow Creek Trail split (.6 miles : 9,993'). The Buffalo Mountain Trail bends southwest and steepens on a wide, rocky path past two nondescript cabin remains. It narrows just past the second remain (1.05 miles : 10,355') and begins an arduous climb up steep, tightly wound switchbacks. The trail rises quickly into a high subalpine forest, which thins to an abrupt break on the edge of a sprawling talus field (1.7 miles : 11,395'). A large cairn marks this important transition, at which point you'll ignore a false spur to the left and head straight into the rock field. Travel slows considerably on a winding, uneven route through the talus. Cairns lead the way, but blend seamlessly with the landscape. Keep track of your progress, avoid deviating from the designated path and pass carefully over loose rock. The trail reaches a ridge and bends northwest, where it leaves the talus for a welcome reprieve in the open tundra (2.1 miles : 12,029'). While terrain is friendlier the grade is not, curling steeply through open tundra on the mountain's northeast slope. Views include Eccles Pass (11,917'), Red Peak (13,189') and South Willow Creek basin. Look for mountain goat, marmot, ptarmigan and elk in this high alpine environment. The trail grows rocky on the final approach to Buffalo Mountain's summit (2.75 miles : 12,777'), which is long, narrow and rugged. Social paths continue south to its bulbous southern tip, a deceptively long and rigorous scramble. Mountain GoatsMountain Goats range across North America's northern mountains, with large populations in Idaho, Montana and British Columbia . They were introduced to Colorado in 1947 to bolster the state's hunting allure, though debate continues regarding their indigenous status. Mountain Goat live in small groups at high elevations, feeding on alpine tundra grasses, mosses, lichens and sedges. Billies can weigh up to 300 pounds, and nannies are somewhat smaller. Both have sharp black horns that can reach 12 inches. Heavily cushioned, skid-proof hooves give them exceptional balance and traction, and double-layered wool coats can withstand extreme weather conditions. Since they rarely venture below treeline, they have few natural predators. Avalanches and rocks slides are their primary concern, though eagles are known to knock smaller animals off cliffs, and mountain lion have some success hunting in their lower range.",79.25
265,Lily Pad Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,3.2,9824,9928,104,1,True,"Lily Pad Lake is located 1.6 miles from Buffalo Mountain Trailhead in the Eagles Nest Wilderness. This short, family-friendly hike leads through a rich montane forest to adjacent lily-covered lakes in the shadow of Buffalo Mountain (12,777'). Visitors will enjoy 3-4 season access, mild grades and several beaver ponds en route to the lake. The trail begins at the south end of the Buffalo Mountain - Lily Pad Lake parking area. Follow the service road up and keep right of the utility station to pick up the trail in a thick lodgepole forest (.15 miles : 9,905'). The path is initially wide, level and softened by pine needles. It moves quickly past the Eagles Nest Wilderness Boundary (.3 miles : 9,912') to a large beaver pond on the right. The trail skirts a second pond and passes through a grassy clearing, a good place to look for deer, elk and moose (.75 miles : 9,859'). The grade steepens on a rockier path to the Salt Lick Trail junction (1.1 miles : 10,003'), near which several beaver ponds can be found hidden in the forest. Here the trail levels along its highest point and drops gradually to the edge of Lily Pad Lake #1 (1.55 miles : 9,942'), a small depression blanketed in pond lilies. The trail continues on a high embankment between the first and second Lily Pad Lake (1.6 miles : 9,928'). The second lake is significantly larger, with excellent views north of Buffalo Mountain. Social trails circle each, with access to sandy openings along the main lake's shore that are suitable for fishing. Those seeking a longer outing and a bit more solitude may continue south on the Lily Pad Lake Trail to Meadow Creek and the Meadow Creek Trail junction (2.65 miles : 9,560'). This hillier section passes through a gorgeous aspen forest and open sage-filled hillsides with sweeping views across the Dillon Reservoir and Ten Mile Range.",79.7833333333
266,Red Buffalo Pass,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,11.2,9774,11742,1968,5,True,"Red Buffalo Pass is located in the Eagles Nest Wilderness Area and Dillon Ranger District of the White River National Forest. Red Buffalo Pass spans a divisive ridge between the South Willow Creek basin (east) and Gore Creek drainage (west).  The pass offers commanding views that include Eccles Pass, 1.5 miles south along the same ridge. Red Buffalo Pass is the primary east-west route for thru-hikes between Silverthorne and Vail. Visitors will enjoy good fishing and camping along South Willow Creek, and several waterfalls and alpine lakes en route to the pass: The trail heads northwest to the Eagles Nest Wilderness Boundary (.35 miles : 9,974') and Buffalo Mountain Trail - South Willow Creek Trail split (.6 miles : 9,993'). The South Willow Creek Trail levels to a small talus field (.8 miles), just over which a notched tree marks the way. A few steps up the trail makes a hard right turn and drops sharply on a rocky path, beginning a shifting series of rugged undulations. Look for arrows, cairns and tree notches on this ill-defined segment. South Willow Creek is soon audible, confirming you're on the right track. Travel eases to a bridge over South Willow Creek (1.65 miles : 9,621') and the Gore Range Trail junction (1.8 miles : 9,678'). The Gore Range Trail turns west and rises steadily to the South Willow Falls Trail split (2.35 miles : 10,037'), then steepens away on switchbacks. Avoid spurs that turn back to the creek. The trail straightens above a deep, narrow gulch carved by South Willow Creek between Buffalo Mountain (south) and Red Peak (north). It moderates through the gap to a clearing (2.9 miles : 10,405') between the creek and base of a rock slide. The trail re-enters timber (3.25 miles : 10,432') and resumes a moderately steep, rugged pace up the south flank of Red Peak. The trail bends southwest (4.45 miles : 11,186') in a thinning forest to treeline (4.8 miles : 11,356'). It emerges in a vast alpine bench at the base of a north-south ridge connecting Eccles Pass and Red Buffalo Pass. Excellent camping terrain can be found throughout this area. Travel continues on a faint path to a sparingly marked split on the edge of a large alpine pond (5.0 miles : 11,424'). Note that a clear path breaks north from this point - ostensibly the correct route - but it in fact soon fades in the grass. To find the correct trail, head northwest over the pond and look for cairns - you'll soon find a clear-cut path that steepens up to Red Buffalo Pass (5.6 miles : 11,742'). Views range over South Willow Creek basin and Gore Creek valley. Eccles Pass (11,924') is located at the south end of the ridge, Buffalo Mountain (12,777') to the east and Grand Traverse to the west.",79.25
267,Gore Range Trail to Lost Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,9.9,9723,11612,1889,4,True,"Lost Lake is located 4.95 miles north of Copper Mountain Ski Resort in the Eagles Nest Wilderness. This moderately-strenuous section of the Gore Range Trail passes through intervals of aspen, subalpine forests and large meadows to the green-tinted lake near treeline and Uneva Pass.  Visitors will enjoy exceptional views across the Gore and Ten Mile ranges and excellent backcountry camping en route to Lost Lake: From Copper Mountain Ski Resort's Alpine Parking Lot, walk .35 miles east over the I-70 pedestrian bridge to a sign marking the Gore Range Trail on your left (9,725'). The trail rises gently through a sage-aspen hillside over I-70, gradually bending N-NW to the Eagles Nest Wilderness Boundary (1.2 miles : 10,195'). The grade steepens considerably through intervals of timber and small clearings to the edge of a large meadow (1.85 miles : 10,778'), a welcome reprieve through archetypal elk and moose habitat. It skirts the meadow and winds to the Wheeler Lakes Trail split (2.55 miles : 11,077'). The Gore Range Trail continues north across a string of meadows and trio of ponds (3.6 miles : 11,365'). It levels by the ponds into a thick forest and rises sharply on a shifting climb to a crest over the top of Officers Gulch. The trail drops into and crosses the marshy drainage on an ill-defined path, negotiating dense willow and rushing streams to a clear path on the far side (4.25 miles : 11,423'). Take a moment to locate the trail before crossing this gulch. Once over it rises through the vestiges of treeline to a talus field (4.65 miles : 11,478') and stream crossing, which is Lost Lake's outlet (4.8 miles : 11,535'). A short push leads to the high east bank of Lost Lake (4.95 miles : 11,621'). Lost Lake is partially concealed by the bank and stands of gnarled spruce, however clearing treeline should prompt you to look back and find it. Consider hiking a bit past the lake and hooking back to its open north shore, a less-obstructed option. Those with time may continue another half mile and 300' up to Uneva Pass, or take a .5 mile roundtrip excursion to Wheeler Lakes on the return.",81.1833333333
268,Gore Range Trail to Wheeler Lakes,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,5.9,9723,11072,1349,3,True,"The Wheeler Lakes are located 2.9 miles north of Copper Mountain Ski Area in the Eagles Nest Wilderness. The lakes fill shallow depressions in a large meadow complex off the Gore Range Trail.  This short, moderately-strenuous hike leads through subalpine forests and high open spaces with good views across the Gore and Ten Mile ranges. Visitors will enjoy wildlife viewing and excellent backcountry camping choices on the way to Wheeler Lakes: From Copper Mountain Ski Resort's Alpine Parking Lot, walk .35 miles east over the I-70 pedestrian bridge to a sign marking the Gore Range Trail on your left (9,725'). The trail rises gently through a sage-aspen hillside over I-70, gradually bending north into a thick forest and across the Eagles Nest Wilderness Boundary (1.2 miles : 10,195'). It steepens considerably through quick intervals of spruce and large clearings to the edge of a broad meadow (1.85 miles : 10,778'), a good place to find wildlife. It skirts the meadow and winds moderately up thinning timber to the Wheeler Lakes Trail split (2.55 miles : 11,077'). The Wheeler Lakes Trail branches northeast and levels in a vast meadow to the first Wheeler Lake (2.75 miles : 11,086'). It continues easily along the west shore through a sliver of trees to the second Wheeler Lake (2.95 miles : 11,067'). The trail continues informally about 150 yards north to an overlook across Officers Gulch and Uneva Pass. Both lake shores are reasonably clear, flat, and easy to explore. Those with time can backtrack to the Gore Range Trail and head north to a string of scenic ponds (1.05 miles from the split), and continue on to Lost Lake (2.4 miles from the split).",81.1833333333
269,Eaglesmere Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,7.2,8737,10397,1660,3,True,"The Eaglesmere Trailhead is located 25.2 miles north of Silverthorne, .3 miles north of the Cataract Lake Campground and Surprise Trailhead. Eaglesmere Lake is comprised of two small lakes separated by an isthmus, both ringed by thick timber and open marsh.  While the lake is rather nondescript, the Eaglesmere Trail is compelling for views over Lower Cataract Lake, Cataract Falls, surrounding peaks and abundant aspen. Wildflowers are prolific and fall colors are exceptional, even by Summit County standards. Moderate grades clear of deadfall are ideal for backpackers, families, runners and winter recreation: The narrow-cut trail begins in a thick aspen forest and verdant, overgrown understory. Columbine are particularly abundant on the first half mile. The trail climbs steadily to a broad, open hillside with terrific views over Lower Cataract Lake and Cataract Falls (.75 miles : 9,157'). Grades moderate across intervals of grassy slopes and aspen groves to the Eagles Nest Wilderness Boundary (2.1 miles : 9,945'). Look for wildlife, especially bears, in this fecund habitat. Eagles Nest ridge (13,091') stands prominently to the south, while the Williams Fork Range frames the eastern horizon. Tipperary Lake can be seen across the valley at about 2.7 miles. Tall conifers with an old growth feel gradually displace aspen as you approach the Gore Trail split (3.0 miles : 10,262'). Despite beetle kill damage, the trail itself is well maintained and obstacle free. The trail crests at 3.25 miles (10,454') and dips to the spur for Eaglesmere Lake (3.5 miles : 10,388'). The spur leads to the NE corner of the first and smaller Eaglesmere Lake (3.55 miles : 10,397'). Follow social trails left to the isthmus separating the two lakes (3.6 miles), which provides simultaneous views and access. This level space has established campsites, and is an ideal spot to picnic. Exploration of the lake vicinity is otherwise limited by thick timber and boulders. Social trails continue around the left (SE) side of the second lake to a large, open marsh on the inlet. Several established campsites can be found along these trails.",108.35
270,Chicago Lakes,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,9.8,10617,11733,1116,4,True,"The Chicago Lakes are accessed from Echo Lake, 13.25 miles south of I-70 (Idaho Springs) in the Mt Evans Wilderness Area. They lie .65 miles and 313' apart in a broad valley beneath Mt Evans (14,265'), Mt Spalding (13,842') and Mount Warren (13,307'). Visitors will enjoy stunning alpine landscapes and wildlife that includes moose, elk, bighorn sheep and mountain goat:  From the parking lot, follow the short dirt path to Echo Lake and continue south to the Chicago Lakes Trail split (.12 miles : 10,597'). A short climb past a second Chicago Lakes Trail sign crests over a deep gorge carved by Chicago Creek with views of Mt Spalding and Mount Evans in the distance. The trail undulates ruggedly on a fast descent through healthy spruce and fir to Chicago Creek (1.1 miles : 10,342'). Cross the creek and emerge a few steps further on a dirt road (1.15 miles : 11,367'). An unofficial-looking sign correctly points up this road on a steady climb to Idaho Springs Reservoir (1.65 miles : 10,617'). It continues to the Mount Evans Wilderness Area Boundary (2.05 miles : 10,652'), where it moderates on a rocky path up the valley's west side. Ridge lines connecting Rogers Peak (13,391') and Mount Warren (13,307') form the east valley wall. The trail enters an area touched by the 1978 Idaho Springs Reservoir Fire, which burned over 400 acres, mostly on the valley's upper west side. Despite its skeletal appearance, the forest is in a natural state of recovery. Grasses and wildflowers fill the hillsides, while young aspen have emerged in replenished soils. In time, spruce and fir will overtake them and return the forest to its ecological climax. The trail is intermittently rocky and steep heading up the valley with a full view of Mt Spalding, and a partial look at Mt Evans. It levels across a major tributary through treeline (3.2 miles : 11,321') to a marked spur for lower Chicago Lake (3.95 miles : 11,545'). Note bristlecone and limber pine in this area, high altitude species adapted to extreme conditions. The lake spur is clear at first, but entangled by willows that require some force to break through and reach the shore (4.1 miles : 11,420'). Once down, a clearer path leads to the open outlet area and northeast shore where you'll find ideal morning light. Afternoon arrivals - or those who simply don't wish to fight the willows - will find easier access further up the main trail, though a steep knoll must be scaled to reach them (.35 miles ahead). From the marked spur, the main trail continues above Chicago Lake up and down a rugged knoll and last thick patch of forest to the lake's far side. It steepens considerably up the rock face separating the two lakes, a strenuous climb with a commanding view over Chicago Lake #1 and the valley below. It crests a ridge in open tundra overlooking upper Chicago Lake, from which the shore is easily reached (4.9 miles : 11,733'). Circle the lake, or continue over its outlet on the trail leading up to Summit Lake (12,830'), which provides panoramas over the basin, and back down the entire Chicago Creek drainage.",59.1166666667
271,Lincoln Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,10.6,10707,11624,917,3,True,"Lincoln Lake is located 5.3 miles from Echo Lake Campground in the Mt Evans Wilderness. It lies at treeline in a narrow, rocky bowl on the east side of Rogers Peak (13,391') ringed by large boulders, dense willow and ancient bristlecone pine trees. The Resthouse Trail and Lincoln Lake Trail form a 5.3 mile route that passes through the 700 acre Lincoln Lake burn area and 1076 acre Resthouse Meadow burn area. While the burn areas are ostensibly barren, they're in fact recovering well and full of life. Fire helps maintain natural tree densities while replenishing soils and clearing space for new growth. These newly formed alpine meadows are rife with wildflowers, and provide critical grazing habitat for elk. Bighorn sheep and mountain goat were unaffected by the fire, and thrive above treeline throughout the wilderness area. There are several ways to reach Lincoln Lake, but the most accessible begins at Echo Lake Campground and follows the Resthouse Trail south to the Lincoln Lake Trail. Other routes have seasonal access restrictions, and are partially obstructed by blow-downs related to the fire. Visitors will enjoy contrastingly healthy and skeletal forests, bristlecone pine stands and good wildlife viewing in these newly opened spaces: The trail begins in the campground, where you must complete a free wilderness use permit before setting out. The Resthouse Trail climbs steadily in a thick spruce-fir forest to a crest at .95 miles (11,083'), where it drops 563' in just over a mile to Vance Creek (2.0 miles : 10,520'). The trail pitches up from the creek on variously moderate, steep and rocky intervals. Travel is pleasant if not uneventful until reaching the Lincoln Lake burn area (4.15 miles : 11,278'). The trail levels across ghostly hillsides to the Lincoln Lake Trail (4.65 miles : 11,422'). which breaks west through a reconstituting forest up to Lincoln Lake (5.3 miles : 11,624'). This final segment is rugged and ill-defined as you approach a crest over the lake basin. The way is intuitively followed, even when the trail is not. Steep walls, boulders and uneven terrain make exploration difficult. High points over the outlet offer the best vantage, and a good place to scan for goats and sheep. While trees are usually scarce at this elevation, bristlecone pine around the lake offer a unique aesthetic. Learn more about Bristlecone Pine Trees and the Mt Goliath Natural Area",59.8333333333
272,Fredonia Gulch to Hoosier Ridge - Red Mountain,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,4.0,10250,11451,1201,3,True,"The Fredonia Gulch Trail provides outstanding views of Summit County and leads to an old mining camp at Hoosier Ridge near the base of Red Mountain. Moderate to steep grades on a well-maintained service road are nicely suited for conditioned families, runners and winter recreationalists. The trailhead is located 4.5 miles south of downtown Breckenridge on Fredonia Gulch Road (Colorado Road 600). The trail begins just past a utility building on the right as you enter the forest. In .1 miles it passes through an official forest service gate labeled CR 600 and climbs steadily through mixed pine with improving westerly views. Massive snowcapped peaks soon emerge behind thick subalpine forests in the foreground. Switchbacks ease through 1.7 miles as the trail bends east and heads directly toward the base of Red Mountain. The remaining .3 miles are rugged and exposed with unabated views to the south and west. Notable summits include (north to south) Crystal Peak (13,852'), Quandary Peak (14,265') and Mt Lincoln (14,286'). The trail ends at an old mining camp on Hoosier Ridge at the base of Red Mountain (2.0 miles : 11,451'). Remnants of mining life still remain, and while exploration is encouraged, caution is a must to avoid stray metal objects hidden by krummholz and underbrush.",100.016666667
273,French Gulch Road to Sallie Barber Mine,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,5.6,10330,10440,110,2,True,"The Sallie Barber Mine is located on the south rim of French Gulch on Barney Ford Hill. The Breckenridge Daily Journal claims the Sallie Barber Mine was established in 1880 by a group of Bald Mountain miners, while The Mining Directory of 1883 shows it was opened in 1882 by G.T. Metzger, a Breckenridge resident.  Both accounts agree it was a small but long-time producer of zinc and other minerals, and an important part of Colorado's Gold Rush era. The mine site has multiple interpretive signs describing its occupational and operational history, and much of the original mining equipment is on display. From the trailhead, follow French Gulch Road .1 miles north to a split for Sallie Barber Road - Marker 2651. Bear right downhill through the metal forest service gate, shortly past which the trail - now a groomed service road - crosses a creek, makes a hairpin turn north and climbs toward the mine. Snowcapped peaks to the west emerge through a healthy pine forest as you gain elevation. The trail itself is rather uneventful until cresting in a clearing at the Sallie Barber Mine and Historic Site (1.45 miles : 10,728'). Sensational panoramas from the site include Mineral Hill (10,891'), Brewery Hill (11,370'), Humbug Hill (11,031') and Farncomb Hill (11,337'). The trail continues past the mine, descending 1.35 miles through a mixed pine forest to the end of Sallie Barber Road (2.8 miles : 10,440').",100.116666667
274,Gold Hill Trail,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,6.6,9219,9989,770,3,True,"The Gold Hill Trail is located 6.1 miles south of I-70 on Highway 9 between Frisco and Breckenridge. It runs 3.3 miles west to the Peaks Trail, a N-S artery that connects the two towns. The Gold Hill Trail is part of the Colorado Trail, which runs nearly 500 miles from Denver to Durango. This short segment begins in the Ten Mile Range foothills and passes through a series of clear cuts made in 1988 and 2008 intended to minimize pine beetle infestation and fire. Like many other places in Summit County, pine beetles have dramatically impacted these lodgepole forests, and clearing out affected areas triggers recovery by creating space for new growth. Though large-scale clear cutting may seem anathema to some, it's vital to the long-term health and safety of these mountain forest communities. Young aspen have already taken root while native grasses and brush fill the glades. In fact, the Gold Hill Trail is an excellent place to see wildflowers and elk that are drawn to these new food sources. Despite lacking a true alpine aesthetic, this multiuse trail's moderate grades are ideal for running, biking, families and winter recreation: The trail rises above HWY 9 through a broad open slope with good views across the Ten Mile Range and Breckenridge Ski Area. It climbs steadily into thicker timber and briefly merges with a service road (.95 miles : 9,670'), then immediately veers left back onto the trail. Keep right at an unmarked fork shortly past the road (1.1 miles: 9,770'). Travel moderates through intervals of clear cuts and thick, uniform lodgepole up to Gold Hill, an unmarked and anticlimactic high point along the trail (2.4 miles : 10,315'). This is a fine stopping point for those with limited time. From Gold Hill, the trail tilts down a steeper grade that winds to the Peaks Trail junction along Miners Creek (3.3 miles : 9,989'). This verdant, marshy area is a good place to find wildlife. From this point, the Peaks Trail runs 6.5 miles south to Breckenridge, and 3.5 miles north to Frisco. Pine Beetles Bark beetles are native insects that under normal conditions help forests cull older trees and make room for new growth. Pine beetles affect trees by laying eggs under the bark, introducing a fungus that reduces overall resistance and blocks water and nutrient transport. Periodic outbreaks have occurred throughout history, however none as severe as this recent epidemic. Cold winters can kill beetle eggs and regulate populations. Unusually hot summers, warm winters and a prolonged dry spell over the region in the last 10 years have led to increased beetle activity while weakening trees natural resistance. While there is no effective way to safely control an outbreak of this magnitude, recent surveys suggest a modest decline in infestations as the availability of healthy trees has declined.",83.35
275,Deluge Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,9.1,8721,11746,3025,5,True,"Deluge Lake is located 4.55 miles from Gore Creek Trailhead in the Eagles Nest Wilderness north of Vail. It sits above treeline at the head of a broad valley deep in the Gore Range. The Deluge Lake Trail is highlighted by abundant aspen and long stretches of alpine meadow. Visitors will enjoy varied terrain, airy landscapes and well-earned solitude on the challenging hike to Deluge Lake: The trail rises quickly to the Deluge Lake - Gore Creek Trail split and banks north (.1 mile). It moderates across a grassy slope to a sharp NE turn that begins a long, strenuous climb (.35 miles : 8,778'). The trail is narrowly cut, overgrown in many places and variously rocky and slick with loose sand. Tread carefully along short sections with steep drop-offs. It reaches a break in the aspen and levels across 100 yards of talus (1.35 miles : 9,925'). Steep climbing leads into the subalpine (1.6 miles : 10,265') where grades moderate under a tall spruce-fir canopy (2.0 miles : 10,690'). Look for grouse, elk and bear in this dark and verdant stretch. The trail crests on a high ridge near treeline, but promptly drops back into the forest (2.75 miles : 11,076'). It passes through a large clearing (3.05 miles : 11,007') and undulates down to Deluge Creek with expanding views of the upper valley (3.4 miles : 10,945'). The trail runs up the west bank of Deluge Creek for a short time as another becomes visible along the east bank (3.65 miles : 11,145'). Remain vigilant, as the trail will cross Deluge Creek to the east side at an unmarked point. Find a narrow point to cross and resume steep climbing through the last of treeline. Travel gradually eases across a string of alpine meadows (4.05 miles : 11,325') and makes one final push to a crest that dips on a faint path to Deluge Lake (4.55 miles : 11,746'). The lake vicinity and slopes above are relatively obstacle free and easy to explore. Look for mountain goat along serrated ridgelines framing the valley. Grand Traverse Peak (13,041') caps the Deluge basin's northwest corner, while triangular Snow Peak (13,024') distinguishes the east valley wall. Views down valley include summits from the Ten Mile and Sawatch ranges. Skilled hikers can scale Snow Peak's north saddle and drop to Snow Lake, which has no maintained trail leading to it. A challenging x-country loop can be formed by following Snow Lake's outlet to the Gore Lake Trail, which joins the Gore Creek Trail back to the Gore Creek Trailhead in Vail.",99.25
276,Gore Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,12.2,8721,11414,2693,5,True,"Gore Lake is located 6.1 miles north of Vail in the Eagles Nest Wilderness. It fills a large basin at treeline beneath Snow Peak (13,024'), Willow Peak (13,357') and Red Peak (13,189'). The hike to Gore Lake follows Gore Creek 4.2 miles east before breaking north up a steep gulch that levels in a string of alpine meadows below the lake. Gore Lake is compelling for its abundant cutthroat trout, idyllic setting and isolated location deep in the Gore Range: The Gore Creek Trail heads east through intervals of meadow and aspen, joining Gore Creek briefly over a cascade (.9 miles : 9,075') before edging back up the north valley wall. Travel eases to a bridge (1.8 miles : 9,517'), then undulates ruggedly in dense forest that breaks at a long opening in the valley cleared by avalanches (2.0 miles : 9,521'). Talus and scree along the path were brought down from steep slopes above, now clear of timber and a good place to see wildlife moving about. The trail re-enters dense lodgepole (2.45 miles : 9,733') and moderates to a lazy oxbow in the creek (2.7 miles : 9,802'). Lush grasses, wildflowers and shade highlight this mild segment. The trail steepens to another major clearing (3.2 miles : 9,908'), then eases back into a pristine swath of spruce and fir by the creek (3.5 miles : 9,945'). This next mile offers better fishing access and camping terrain, logistically desirable overnight locations before the strenuous push to Gore Lake or Red Buffalo Pass. The Gore Creek Trail reaches the Gore Lake Trail split at the foot of another opening in the valley and turns sharply north (4.2 miles : 10,194'). It steepens on a twisting climb beside a creek before leveling in a high subalpine forest (4.75 miles : 10,794'). Travel steadies through an expanding alpine landscape where the trail may be faint, washed-out or snow-covered in places. The trail generally favors the gentle west side of the meadow before making a counter -intuitive turn up the steep and cluttered west ridge (5.4 miles : 10,975'). It begins a shifting climb to a large cairn and hairpin turn (right) just below the lake (6.0 miles : 11,341'). A short climb through the last of treeline leads to the SE shore of Gore Lake (6.1 miles : 11,414'). The perimeter and slopes above are easy to explore. Anglers will find good fishing along the outlet, and in a number of outlying ponds. Scramble up the west shore for panoramas across the Gore Lake basin, Ten Mile Range and Sawatch Range.",99.25
277,Grays Peak and Torreys Peak,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,8.35,11259,14270,3011,5,True,"Grays Peak (14,270') and Torreys Peak (14,267') are the two highest points along the Continental Divide, and considered among the most accessible fourteeners in Colorado. The summits are connected by a .8 mile long saddle, making both attainable in a day with an early start. The peaks stand over a deep valley framed by Kelso Mountain (13,164') to the north, and Mount Edwards (13,850') and McClellan Mountain's (13,587) serrated ridge to the south.  The Grays Peak National Recreation Trail scales Stevens Gulch into the upper valley, where it splits for Grays Peak and the saddle between the summits. The following describes clockwise travel to Grays, crosses the saddle to Torreys, and returns by a connector trail to form a lollipop loop: The trail crosses Stevens Gulch Creek and climbs steadily on a wide, rocky path through the last of treeline. Travel is moderate from .8 miles (11,890') - 1.7 miles (12,245'), a chance to make up time in advance of more demanding sections ahead. In 1.7 miles (12,245') the trail steepens up the north side of a divisive ridge in the upper valley; once over it bends east and south again on a more assertive climb into the tundra.The trail curls several times toward the valley-center on a rugged path, pressing steeply in spurts to the split for Grays Peak and Torreys Peak (2.8 miles : 13,273'). Bear left toward Grays on a steady, strenuous climb through uneven talus. Though generally well-defined, be mindful of false splits in the indistinguishable rock-scape. These social trail options generally link back to the main, but lead through unnecessarily challenging terrain. A sharp east-southeast bend marks the final approach, crossing 14,000' at 3.45 miles. The trail narrows and tightens up a few turns just before leveling on Grays Peak (3.7 miles : 14,270'). Look for a Torreys Peak sign on the summit's north side to resume travel. Torreys' conical summit stands .8 miles away across a saddle on the Divide. The trail drops steeply on a rugged, tightly-wound path to the saddle trail connector (4.05 miles : 13,805'). Continue past this split to the saddle's lowest point (4.1 miles : 13,757') before turning uphill for Torreys. The trail is considerably narrower and less stable than what led you to Grays, requiring greater attention to footing and other hikers. You'll cross 14,000' after 4.4 miles on the final push to Torreys Peak (4.55 miles : 14,267'). Retrace your steps back down the saddle, mindful of sliding rock, drop-offs and other hikers. You'll reach the saddle trail connector once again (5.05 miles : 13,805'), this time splitting left down a perennial snowfield on the east side of the Divide. Tread cautiously on this section. Once through the trail becomes quite clear (5.15 miles : 13,795'), and falls quickly back to the original split for Grays Peak and Torreys Peak (5.5 miles : 13,273'). Continue back down the main trail, which gradually moderates back to the Grays Peak - Stevens Gulch Trailhead to complete the hike (8.35 miles : 11,259').",75.6833333333
278,Grouse Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,9.4,7835,10728,2893,3,True,"Grouse Lake is located 4.7 miles from Grouse Creek Trailhead in the Holy Cross Wilderness. It lies in a wide, level basin ringed by thick timber and marshy willow below Grouse Mountain (12,726'). While the lake aesthetic is limited, the hike itself is compelling. The Grouse Lake Trail closely follows Grouse Creek through grassy aspen groves into thick coniferous forests up to the lake. These aspen groves are especially attractive, coupled with abundant flowers and berries along lower portions of the trail. The kinetic creek offers many good places to camp, and wide oxbows on the lake's outlet are ideal for fishing. The trail is moderate with the exception of two short steep sections and potentially voluminous creek crossings during the runoff: The Grouse Lake Trail heads SW across open grassy slopes to the Grouse Lake - West Grouse Creek Trail split (.55 miles : 8,145'). The Grouse Lake Trail veers left; the West Grouse Creek Trail veers right with access to Waterdog Lake, Olsen Lake and the Turquois Lakes. The Grouse Lake Trail rises through intervals of aspen and mixed pine to a vaguely marked obstruction at 1.0 mile (8,437'). This relatively new re-route forces you (right) across two braids of the creek to the west side of the valley. Note the trail is not immediately obvious until reaching the far side. Once over, travel levels through idyllic aspen groves rife with wildflowers. The trail curls back to the creek, again crossing two successive braids back to the east side of the valley (1.5 and 1.55 miles : 8,745'). The second braid can be a little tricky. The trail climbs steeply up the east side of the creek through uniformly tall and beetle-marred lodgepole. It gradually moderates through 1.9 miles (9,130') to another creek crossing (right) at 2.4 miles (9,430'). The bridge is out, and the ford is difficult with swift water. The trail climbs steeply up the west side of the creek, soon moderating for an extended period in a diverse forest broken by sunny glades and large, open slopes ideal for seeing wildlife. It passes through a large meadow at 3.9 miles (10,240'), and re-enters thick timber with some potentially vague sections ahead. The trail shifts quickly, but in each case is intuitively followed beside the creek up to Grouse Lake (4.7 miles : 10,728'). Grouse Mountain crowns the backdrop of this pleasant but subjectively unspectacular basin. Social trails continue around the lake's west side with ample room for fishing and exploration.",105.35
279,Olsen Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,11.2,7835,11268,3433,4,True,"Olsen Lake is located 5.6 miles from Grouse Creek Trailhead in the Holy Cross Wilderness. This small lake is ringed by thick timber at the base of a steep ridge, just over which is the Beaver Creek Ski Area. Its open south shore is ideal for camping, with access to a rolling landscape of talus bowls and alpine ridges that see few people.  While the lake is nondescript, the hike itself is compelling, especially the first two miles through long stretches of flower-studded aspen groves. Olsen Lake comes highly recommended in the fall for its brilliant colors and abundant berries along West Grouse Creek: The Grouse Lake Trail heads SW across open grassy slopes to the Grouse Lake - West Grouse Creek Trail split (.52 miles : 8,145'). The West Grouse Creek Trail veers right to a bridge (1.0 miles : 8,435'), then enters a long stretch of grassy aspen groves beside the creek. Young aspen coupled with the relative absence of mature conifers indicate a recent disturbance that renewed the arboreal cycle. This leafy, food-rich area is a good place to find wildlife. The trail climbs steadily to an unmarked split for an old portion of the Meadow Mountain Trail (1.5 miles : 8,793'), and through a young lodgepole forest thinned by a blow-down (2.0 miles). The forest service has done an excellent job clearing the way, though some trees still cross the trail. The trail rises in a thicker, healthier forest to a bridge crossing (2.6 miles : 9,481'), past which grades moderate across a long, open slope with good views back at the Gore Range. Note swaths of skunk cabbage in sunny areas along the damp creek bank. Grades are variously moderate and steep on a more rugged path through 3.65 miles (10,130'), skirting a few large talus slopes that seem a bit out of place. Pockets of level terrain between the trail and creek are good places to improvise a campsite. The trail graduates into a thick, moss-draped subalpine forest up to the Holy Cross Wilderness Boundary, where backpackers must self-register (4.7 miles : 10,675'). You'll run just below Waterdog Lake before reaching the boundary, however it's largely concealed by timber. Despite great efforts to clear the way, deadfall still spans the trail in several places leading to the Olsen Lake Trail split (approximately 5.05 miles : 10,860'). The Olsen Lake Trail breaks west and twists past talus bowls and small ponds, leveling on the final approach to Olsen Lake (5.6 miles : 11,268'). Pick your way to the open SE shore, which has good views of the immediate area and space to camp and fish. Scale the unnamed ridge above to an unnamed 12,161' peak that has excellent views across the Beaver Creek Ski Area and Holy Cross Wilderness.",105.35
280,Abyss Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,17.1,9654,12650,2996,5,True,"Abyss Lake is located in a deep glacial cirque between Mt Bierstadt (14,060') and Mt Evans (14,265'). The Abyss Trail begins 20 miles south of Georgetown on Guanella Pass Road, and travels 8.55 miles northeast through the Mt Evans Wilderness to the lake. While the lake is exceptional, the hike in is equally compelling. Visitors will enjoy pristine valleys, abundant aspen, open alpine travel and excellent backcountry camping en route to Abyss Lake: The trail begins on a steady grade through uniform lodgepole and young aspen (1.0 miles : 10,020'). It crosses south over Scott Gomer Creek (2.15 miles : 10,162') and levels beside it through dense aspen. There are several established campsites on this stretch with great views up-valley. Look for moose in the willow-shrouded creek corridor. The trail crosses back over the creek (3.2 miles : 10,395') and climbs steeply away on a rocky, shifting path to a large, marshy meadow (3.8 miles : 10,682'). The valley opens and forest breaks at the first of two Rosalie Trail splits (4.2 miles : 10,880'). Follow signs to the second Rosalie - Abyss Trail split (4.4 miles : 10,878'). Here the trail becomes steep, faint and obstructed by deadfall. Though brief, this section is difficult to navigate and reclaim the trail once off course. Pay close attention as you progress. Travel moderates in a thinning forest touched by wildfire (5.0 miles : 11,265'), and levels across expanding meadows with many good places to camp (5.5 miles : 11,430'). It weaves through the vestiges of treeline to Helms Lake (11,750' : 6.15 miles), a worthwhile destination in itself. The lake's south slope provides good terrain and tree-cover for backpackers. The trail intuitively skirts the lake, but is enveloped by willow and difficult to follow. You'll likely get wet improvising to the far side where it clarifies on drier ground. The trail continues NE above the lake into open alpine with views of Mt Bierstadt, Mt Evans, and Epaulet Mountain (13,523'). It crosses Lake Fork Creek (7.2 miles : 12,168') and turns sharply NW for the cirque. Short, steep intervals moderate in rolling alpine tundra to Abyss Lake (8.55 miles : 12,650'). The lake's south shore and outlying tarns are easy to explore. Glass the cirque walls for mountain goat, bighorn sheep, and hikers on Mt Bierstadt and Mt Evans.",79.0833333333
281,Mt Bierstadt,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,7.4,11656,14060,2404,4,True,"Mt Bierstadt (14,060') is located 11.8 miles south of Georgetown, CO in the Pike National Forest and Mt Evans Wilderness Area. A well-maintained trail leads 3.7 miles east from Guanella Pass to the summit. Though widely considered the most attainable of all Colorado 14ers, considerable effort is still required. Visitors will enjoy excellent views and alpine wildlife on the hike to Mt Bierstadt:  The Mt Bierstadt Trail drops past Deadman's Lake to its low point at Scott Gomer Creek on the valley floor (.8 miles : 11,541'). It climbs steadily out of the valley through the vestiges of treeline into the tundra. Look for ptarmigan, marmot, elk, and bighorn sheep on these broad, open slopes. The trail steepens past 1.7 miles (11,975') with rangy views across Guanella Pass. It gradually curls south across a sloping bench with good views down a side drainage where you might find mountain goat along rugged ledges (2.3 miles : 12,520') . The grade intensifies through 2.65 miles (12,795') on a straight line to the west ridge of Mt Bierstadt. The trail crosses 13,000' at 2.85 miles on a wide path that becomes more rugged and less defined as you progress. It moderates on the rocky ridge to a saddle just beneath the summit (3.45 miles : 13,776'). The final .25 mile is a steep, strenuous scramble through uneven talus. Cairns mark the way, however many alternative routes have formed that are just as viable. The Mt Bierstadt summit (3.7 miles : 14,060') is fairly small and often crowded, but there's still room to move about. Panoramic views include the Sawtooth formation that extends north from the summit, Abyss Lake (12,650'), Mt Evans (14,265') and Mt Spalding (13,842'). Views west over Guanella Valley are magnificent, with Grays Peak (14,270') and Torreys Peak (14,267') on the western horizon.",77.95
282,Square Top Lakes,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,4.6,11678,12265,587,3,True,"The Square Top Lakes are located 1.83 and 2.15 miles west of Guanella Pass along the South Park Trail. Both lie in open tundra directly beneath eponymous Square Top Mountain (13,794').  Visitors will enjoy a relatively easy hike through an exceptional alpine landscape to the lakes. Mild trail conditions are well suited for runners, backpackers, families and winter recreation: The South Park Trail begins on the west side of Guanella Pass in the auxiliary parking lot for Mt Bierstadt. It drops gently through a west-facing valley before edging steeply to a crest on the north valley wall (1.45 miles : 12,055'). The trail dips back through willow to the edge of a talus field, which momentarily obscures the way. It soon clarifies and rises back to lower Square Top Lake (1.83 miles : 12,046'), which fills a broad depression in the open tundra. Anglers will enjoy ample room and access, however backpackers may feel a little exposed to crowds. The South Park Trail continues to a marked spur (2.0 miles : 12,175') that breaks steeply north to upper Square Top Lake (2.3 miles : 12,265'). This final approach may be vague with lingering snow, but the outlet stream is intuitively followed. Suitable camping terrain can be found along the outlet and lake perimeter. A social trail rings the lake, and surrounding slopes are fairly easy to scale for additional perspective. Look for mountain goat and bighorn sheep along ridges, and elk and moose in the valley below. Square Top Mountain is accessible, however routes directly off the South Park Trail are preferable to starting within the lake basin.",79.1333333333
283,Silver Dollar Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,3.3,11235,11950,715,3,True,"Silver Dollar Lake (11,950') is located 1.65 miles from the Silver Dollar Lake Trailhead off Guanella Pass Road, 9.9 miles south of the I-70 Georgetown exit (#228). It lies above treeline in a broad alpine valley framed by Square Top Mountain (south), and Mount Wilcox (north). The Silver Dollar Lake Trail continues .5 miles to Murray Lake just below the Continental Divide. Visitors will enjoy open alpine landscapes and excellent fishing at Silver Dollar and Murray lakes: The trail climbs steadily through the vestiges of treeline to a ridge over Naylor Lake (.6 miles : 11,605'), which is private property. Short, steep intervals continue through open tundra to Silver Dollar Lake (1.65 miles : 11,950'). The lake perimeter is generally obstacle-free and easy to explore. Anglers will have ample room and easy access, and backpackers will find soft ground all around the lake. A well defined trail continues steeply over Silver Dollar Lake to Murray Lake (2.15 miles : 12,178'), centered in the upper valley with excellent views of surrounding peaks. Mount Wilcox (13,408') is a challenging but non-technical summit from this point. Square Top Mountain (13,794') is a more ambitious climb, and arguably an easier route is available from Square Top Lakes in the adjacent valley. Mountain goat and bighorn sheep inhabit the valley's high walls and ridges, while elk and moose frequent the alpine meadows below. Binoculars are highly recommended on this trail.",72.5833333333
284,Lake Constantine,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,7.9,10325,11371,1046,3,True,"Lake Constantine is located 3.95 miles from Tigiwon Road in the Holy Cross Wilderness. It occupies an open basin near treeline ringed by damp meadows, tree-topped knolls and rocky outcrops. The lake is especially popular among backpackers for its accommodating terrain, excellent fishing and proximity to the Tuhare Lakes, Fall Creek Pass and Seven Sisters Lakes:  The trail begins on a moderate grade in a heavy spruce-fir forest. It dips at 1.3 miles (10,840') across a steep, open slope with great views of Fall Creek and distant peaks in the Gore Range.  Walk through a stream that bisects the trail at 1.52 miles and resume steady travel past interesting rock features to the Notch Mountain Trail split (2.34 miles : 11,225'). The Fall Creek Trail continues SW on mild-moderate undulations to the base of a talus slide and meadow (3.5 miles : 11,240'). It steepens away into the upper valley, where the landscape opens to rolling alpine meadows on the NE corner of Lake Constantine (3.95 miles : 11,371'). This large, shapely lake is easy and fun to explore. Social trails circle the area and lead to more private areas and ready-to-use campsites. Damp meadows on the east side are rife with flowers, notably elephants head, queens crown, clover and marsh marigold. The main trail continues up the north side to the inlet area and Tuhare Lakes Trail split (4.55 miles : 11,510'). This attractive space in the upper valley is crossed by streams and lush meadows, and definitely worth exploring if not aiming for the lakes or Fall Creek Pass.",148.9
285,Notch Mountain Trail,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,10.4,10325,13077,2752,4,True,"Mount of the Holy Cross (14,005') earned its name and fame when William Henry Jackson photographed a snow-filled couloir that resembled a cross on the peak's NE face in 1873. Adventurers soon followed on the trek to Notch Mountain, which is optimally positioned to view the cross. The CCC was later commissioned to build Tigiwon Road, the Notch Mountain Trail and Notch Mountain Shelter for visitors expected to make the pilgrimage each year. The Notch Mountain Trail doesn't reach the summit-proper, but leads to the shelter on a saddle just below it (13,077'). This airy expanse offers spectacular views of Mount of the Holy Cross and adjacent peaks on the Holy Cross Ridge. Despite depictions of steep switchbacks on a map, the trail was constructed very well and travel is never too difficult. Visitors will enjoy open alpine landscapes and access to this historic shelter on the Notch Mountain Trail: The trail begins on a moderate grade in a thick subalpine forest. It dips across a steep, open slope with rangy views over Fall Creek and peaks in the Gore and Ten Mile ranges (1.3 miles : 10,840'). It continues through a stream that bisects the trail (1.52 miles) and undulates to the Notch Mountain Trail split (2.34 miles : 11,225'). The Notch Mountain Trail turns away on switchbacks that climb methodically to the edge of treeline. It emerges from the last tall stand of trees across a broad, south-facing slope that supports a brilliant collection of flowers (2.9 miles : 11,650'). The trail climbs steadily on long-leg switchbacks over treeline with expanding views across the valley (3.45 miles : 12,000'). Switchbacks gradually shorten over rockier terrain past 3.95 miles (12,310'). Look for marmot and ptarmigan as you progress, and note the abundance of old-man-of-the-mountain sunflowers and cushion plants between talus slides. The mountain's eponymous 'Notch' is in sight much of the way, but the trail never aims for it. Peaks at the head of Fall Creek and a trio of tarns come in view on the final push to Notch Mountain Shelter (5.2 miles : 13,077'). The shelter is located on a broad saddle with thick tundra grasses that give it a backyard feel. The Holy Cross couloir and peaks of Holy Cross Ridge stand prominently across an unnamed basin. Explore the saddle but remain on rock whenever possible to avoid trampling sensitive vegetation. Continue west along the Halo Ridge to see the Bowl of Tears basin and Cross Creek headwaters.",148.9
286,Tuhare Lakes,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,11.2,10325,12365,2040,4,True,"The Tuhare Lakes are located 5.6 miles from Tigiwon Road in the Holy Cross Wilderness. The upper lake occupies a massive cirque carved from the Holy Cross Ridge, and the lower lake is 275' below in a high alpine terrace. Upper Tuhare Lake (12,365') is notably large for a lake at this elevation. The Fall Creek Trail runs high along the west valley wall before opening in the upper valley at Lake Constantine, past which the Tuhare Lakes Trail splits off on a strenuous climb to the lakes. Visitors will enjoy excellent fishing, scenic waterfalls and imposing alpine backdrops on the hike to the Tuhare Lakes: The trail begins on a moderate grade in a thick subalpine forest. It dips at 1.3 miles (10,840'), the first of several subtle drops that add up on the return. Timber breaks here on a steep slope with good views across Fall Creek and distant peaks in the Gore and Ten Mile ranges. Walk through a stream that bisects the trail at 1.52 miles and resume steady travel past interesting rock features to the Notch Mountain Trail split (2.34 miles : 11,225'). The Fall Creek Trail continues SW on mild-moderate undulations to the base of a talus slide and meadow (3.5 miles : 11,240'). It steepens away into the upper valley where the landscape opens to rolling alpine meadows and Lake Constantine (3.95 miles : 11,371'). Lake Constantine is a compelling destination in itself, with exceptional fishing and ideal camping terrain. The trail fades and splits through damp meadows around the lake, but clarifies on higher ground on the west side.  The trail undulates past Constantine in a thinning forest to the Tuhare Lakes Trail split (4.55 miles : 11,505'). The Tuhare Lakes Trail splits west and clears treeline on a steep, twisting climb beside the lower lake's outlet falls. Some hand-over-hand scrambling is required on this segment. It levels briefly with a great look at the waterfall (4.95 miles), then presses steeply right beside it to Lower Tuhare Lake (5.2 miles : 12,090'). Talus or snow may obscure cairns but the route is fairly obvious. The lake fills a scenic alpine terrace with thick grasses, large boulders and a diverse collection of flowers. The intermittently defined trail continues along the north shore and scales rugged terrain beside the waterfall's upper tier. The falls are spectacular, but avoid adjacent rock slabs that can be perilously slick.  The landscape will naturally funnel you (left) across the top of the waterfall to Upper Tuhare Lake (5.6 miles : 12,365'). Note the route you took, as it may be difficult to retrace. Upper Tuhare Lake is massive, and ringed by jagged 13,000'+ peaks of the Holy Cross Ridge. Scan slopes above for mountain goat and bighorn sheep, which are common in this area.",148.9
287,Hanging Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,2.4,6122,7290,1168,5,False,"Hanging Lake fills a 1.5-acre shelf suspended from the walls of Deadhorse Canyon, a side canyon north of Glenwood Canyon and tributary of the Colorado River. The lake is fed by natural springs and the arms of Bridal Veil Falls. This National Natural Landmark was formed by a geologic fault that caused the lakebed to drop away from the valley floor above. Layers of travertine, accumulating over millennia from dissolved limestone, comprise the lake edge and give the water its turquois color. The lake is the centerpiece of a unique ecosystem that supports equally rare plants and hanging gardens. A strenuous 1.2 mile, 1168' climb follows Deadhorse Creek under a shady canopy to the lake. Hanging Lake is accessed from Exit 125 on I-70 in Glenwood Canyon (see important directions and parking information below). The Hanging Lake Trailhead is located about .4 miles from the parking lot along the Glen Canyon Recreation Path and Colorado River. You must walk/bike the path to reach the trailhead from the parking area: The trail climbs fast on a variously steep and rocky path beside Deadhorse Creek all the way to the lake. The cascading creek is a compelling destination in itself, shaded by oak, cottonwood and pine. Deciduous vegetation, ferns and thimbleberries line this kinetic corridor. The grade eases through .75 miles before a steep push up fence-guarded stone steps leading to boardwalks around Hanging Lake (1.2 miles : 7,323'). Upon reaching the lake, a short spur veers left and above Bridal Veil Falls to Spouting Rock, where water has carved its way through narrow chutes in the limestone wall and joins a powerful waterfall. Visitors have more freedom to explore this area and pass under the falls. Hanging Lake is a rare and fragile ecosystem - rules and regulations are strictly enforced: It's illegal to swim, wade or fish in the lake.  Dogs are not permitted on the Hanging Lake Trail.  Remain on designated trails and boardwalks at all times.  Small amounts of oil from human skin can dissolve travertine by altering its pH, and the rock itself can easily crack under the weight of footsteps.  Plants in and around the lake are equally sensitive, and should not be stepped upon or handled.",142.4
288,Hell's Hole Trail,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,8.2,9703,11564,1861,3,True,"The Hell's Hole Trail begins 9.7 miles south of Idaho Springs in the West Chicago Creek Campground. The trail runs 4.1 miles through the Mt Evans Wilderness to a scenic tarn at the head of a wide glacial valley. The seasonal tarn occupies a broad, marshy basin ringed by ancient bristlecone pine trees in a park-like setting. Visitors will enjoy abundant aspen, diverse wildlife and large bristlecone stands against a high alpine backdrop: The trail begins on a steady climb through tall, arching aspen up to the Mt Evans Wilderness Boundary (.95 miles : 10,280'). Don't forget to fill out the free (but required) registration form shortly past the trailhead. The trail gains 1200' in the first two miles before moderating in a healthy spruce-fir forest (2.0 miles : 10,895'). Expect rocky conditions and a few vague areas higher up. Travel quickens on a level ridge (2 - 2.5 miles) with expanding views across the valley. The forest opens abruptly at treeline with a dramatic look at the full cirque (3.7 miles : 11,410'). Willow mats choke the damp central valley, while the trail edges west and above through open bristlecone stands up to the Hell's Hole Tarn (4.0 miles : 11,537'). The trail simply fades in a clearing just past the tarn and last cluster of trees (4.1 miles : 11,564'). Scan the high slopes for elk, mountain goat and bighorn sheep, all which are common in this area. Challenging but non-technical routes continue up the east wall to Gray Wolf Mountain (13,602'). About Bristlecone Pine Bristlecone pine have unique adaptations to survive persistent winds, high elevation, cold temperatures and short growing seasons: The bristlecone short, twisted trunk stabilizes the tree, while flexible branches bend in the wind.  Slow growth rates: Bristlecones may take a century to add just 1"" in diameter, and can become nearly dormant during a drought.  Trees replace needles once every 10-15 years rather than annually, which conserves energy.  Narrow growth rings create dense wood that's resistant to insects and disease. The tree's resin also combats insects and disease.  Strip-barking enables a small strip of bark to nourish large branches and needle clusters.",58.1833333333
289,Continental Divide Trail: Herman Gulch to Jones Pass,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,17.0,10332,12478,2146,5,True,"The Continental Divide Trail (CDT) stretches over 3100 miles from Mexico to Canada, 800 miles of which pass through Colorado. There are innumerable places to pick up the trail, many within an hour drive of the Denver metro area. One such point is Herman Gulch, located north of Bakerville, CO in the Clear Creek Ranger District of the Arapaho National Forest. This segment of the CDT scales two rich drainages up to the Divide, where it runs north at elevations between 12,500' - 13,300' to its next access point at Jones Pass. This lengthy and challenging section is positioned well for a two car shuttle, but can be completed in a day with good physical conditioning and cooperative weather. Visitors will enjoy miles of open travel at exhilarating heights, unabated panoramas across the northeastern Rockies and diverse wildlife viewing opportunities throughout. The Herman Gulch Trail begins on a mild grade through fir and aspen to the Watrous Gulch Trail split and bears north (.17 miles : 10,376'). It steepens considerably on a wide, rocky track to Herman Gulch, where it bends NW and moderates along the creek (.5 miles : 10,690'). The trail rises steadily into a long, wide meadow in the lower gulch (1.05 miles : 10,940'). The grade relaxes up a widening valley with views of Pettingell Peak (13,553') and Hagar Mountain (13,195'). Look for moose along the willow-lined creek below, and elk on the slopes of Mount Bethel (12,705') to the south. Travel is quick while gaining only 300' between the first and second mile (2.0 miles : 11,288'). At 2.45 miles (11,464') it edges back into a healthy forest and climbs steeply above the gulch, passing through treeline just before reaching the Jones Pass split (2.85 miles : 11,838'). The CDT bends sharply east and glides easily across treeline to a crest separating Herman Gulch from the Woods Creek drainage (3.5 miles : 11,953'). Note that a spur branches east from this crest to reach nearby summits, a tempting excursion for those with time, and important navigational mark on the return. Here the trail veers NW and drops gently through a transitional landscape across Woods Creek; once over it angles back NE and steepens into the tundra (3.95 miles : 11,878'). The trail climbs steadily through open space to a cairn and sharp northwest turn for a strenuous push to the Divide (4.7 miles : 12,408'). The triangular summit of Pettingell Peak dominates the foreground as you come upon the Divide and first glimpse down the west side (5.15 miles : 12,807'). Another spur peels off to reach Pettingell, but you'll bear north on what become tightly wound switchbacks up to a pointy summit (5.5 miles : 13,143'). The trail continues down a short saddle and up to a second summit - the route's highest point (5.75 miles : 13,232'). This is a an ideal turnaround point for those with limited time. From the second summit, the trail drops and rises back on a notably rugged path that wraps just below the west side of a third summit. Tread carefully through this uneven talus. Once through (6.0 miles : 13,079'), conditions improve considerably on the final 2.5 mile run to Jones Pass. While grades are modest, they're cumulatively taxing at this elevation. Pace yourself, as the return from Jones Pass requires another 1,600' of climbing back to Herman Gulch. The trail moves to the Divide's center, dipping and rising along lofty saddles with sensational views in every direction. Hassel Lake (11,335') can be seen immediately down the east slope, backed by countless summits of the Winter Park and James Peak Wilderness Area. To the west are panoramas of the Gore Range, and everything in between. Look for ptarmigan, marmot and mountain goat defying the highest ridges as you progress. With Jones Pass in sight, the trail passes under power lines (7.8 miles : 12,581') and crosses a short talus field on the west side of a small summit (8.0 miles : 12,621'). Once over, it drops swiftly down a rocky path to the dirt road and parking area at Jones Pass (8.5 miles : 12,468').",57.9666666667
290,Herman Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,6.5,10332,11987,1655,3,True,"Herman Lake (11,987') is located north of Bakerville, CO in the Clear Creek Ranger District of the Arapaho National Forest. It lies at the head of a broad valley in open, rolling tundra just east of the Continental Divide. The Herman Gulch Trail, which is part of the Continental Divide Trail, follows Herman Gulch through scenic meadows to treeline, where it branches off on a well-defined path to Herman Lake. Visitors will enjoy good trail conditions, open alpine landscapes and a chance to see bighorn sheep and mountain goat in their natural habitat: The Herman Gulch Trail begins in a fir-aspen forest to the Watrous Gulch Trail split and bears north (.17 miles : 10,376'). It steepens on a wide, rocky track to Herman Gulch, where it bends northwest and moderates along the creek and string of slender glades (.5 miles : 10,690'). The trail rises steadily beside the creek into a long meadow in the lower gulch (1.05 miles : 10,940'). Travel moderates with emerging views of the Continental Divide between Pettingell Peak (13,553') and Hagar Mountain (13,195'). Look for moose along the willow-lined creek, and deer and elk on the grassy slopes of Mount Bethel (12,705') to the south. The trail moves quickly up-valley, gaining only 300' between the first and second mile (2.0 miles : 11,288'). At 2.45 miles (11,464') it edges back into forest and climbs steeply above the gulch, passing treeline just before reaching the CDT - Jones Pass Trail split (2.85 miles : 11,838'). Follow signs west to Herman Lake. The Herman Lake Trail climbs steadily into an expansive alpine landscape, easing across open tundra flats to Herman Lake (3.25 miles : 11,987'). Herman Lake is framed by the steep east wall of Pettingell Peak, but is free of major obstacles and easy to explore. The main trail continues past the lake, eventually fading in the tundra on an informal run up to the Divide. Climb knolls over the east shore for panoramas across the basin, and scan valley walls for bighorn sheep and mountain goat which inhabit this area.",57.9666666667
291,Lonesome Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,10.4,10020,11571,1551,3,True,"Lonesome Lake is located 5.2 miles from Homestake Reservoir in the Holy Cross Wilderness. It lies just above treeline surrounded by grassy slopes, large boulders and krummholz-topped knolls.  The Lonesome Lake Trail follows East Fork Homestake Creek through large meadows with slow oxbows and rich habitat for wildlife. Sunny glades throughout support a full spectrum of flowers, and give it an airy feel. Most hikers in this area head for Missouri and Fancy lakes, and overlook this attractive destination. Visitors will enjoy great camping and lighter crowds at Lonesome Lake: The trail rises quickly past the dam to a crest, then drops to a skinny, elevated bridge over the creek (.65 miles : 10,340'). Crossing in the water may be easier/safer if wet or with a heavy pack. Travel moderates up the west side of the creek to the first of three large meadows (1.5 miles : 10,455'). This damp, diversely vegetated area is a great place to see wildlife and fish oxbows in the center. The trail runs through open space before undulating away in the forest. It's possible to stay in the meadow and follow a social track across, knowing at some point you'll need to improvise back. The main trail reaches a high point at the far end of the meadow (2.25 miles), and resumes mild-moderate undulations through bands of timber and glades. It drops to a second meadow and toggles between the forest and open space (2.7 miles : 10,585'). You may continue in this meadow as well, but terrain is more uneven and cluttered than the first. Grades steepen past the second meadow on a variously faint, shifting and rooted path (3.5 miles : 10,725'). Travel is still generally moderate to a third meadow (4.55 miles : 11,225'), at the far end of which is a steep slope that you'll scale through treeline into a postcard-like setting. The trail loses clarity in places, but is intuitively followed up-valley to Lonesome Lake (5.2 miles : 11,571'). Rolling meadows, ponds, pockets of krummholz and large boulders surround the lake, offering privacy and fun nooks to explore. Scale slopes for an aerial view of the basin, and continue all the way to a low ridge on the Continental Divide, where you can peer down on Timberline Lake in a large cirque near Leadville CO.",151.216666667
292,Mirror Lake (Summit County - Eagles Nest Wilderness Area),summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,14.05,8605,10559,1954,5,True,"The Surprise Trailhead is located 25 miles northwest of Silverthorne, CO in the Eagles Nest Wilderness Area. It provides access to a string of subalpine lakes of varying distance and difficulty, all sought for their backcountry camping, fishing and solitude.  Mirror Lake is arguably the most challenging of the group, located 1.65 miles past the split for Upper Cataract Lake in a rugged landscape. Visitors will enjoy access to numerous lakes and deep backcountry scenery on the hike to Mirror Lake: The Surprise Trail rises steadily through aspen-studded hillsides on a S-SE heading to the Eagles Nest Wilderness Boundary (.27 miles : 8,725'). It passes through a large aspen grove (.8 miles) to a stream and makeshift bridge (1.0 mile : 9,135'); once over it steepens beside a long, slender meadow. Though badly marred by pine beetle, deadfall has cleared space for new growth and verdant ground cover. A steady, steep climb continues over a second creek (2.4 miles : 9,905') and moderates to the Gore Range Trail split (2.7 miles : 9,953'). Follow signs to Surprise Lake (2.9 miles : 10,044'). Surprise Lake is partially concealed by thick forest and marshy bands between the trail and north shore. Dora Mountain (12,292') reflects in this small, lily covered lake. The trail keeps west to the Upper Cataract Trail split and veers SW into a markedly healthier forest on the hike's most pleasant stretch (3.45 miles : 10,387'). It rises gently and shifts frequently to its highest point (5.0 miles : 10,890'), then drops sharply to a large talus field at the base of Eagles Nest Peak (5.15 miles : 10,825'). The trail twists around the talus with great views of Cat Lake down to the Upper Cataract Lake split (5.35 miles : 10,725'). A short spur leads to Upper Cataract Lake (10,744'), a recommended detour. The trail continues over Upper Cataract's outlet, a tricky crossing with a vague pickup on the other side. The Cat Lake spur is located just ahead (5.45 miles : 10,615'), a more demanding and less compelling side trip. Here the trail tilts downhill and undulates on a frequently obstructed path to a poorly marked switchback down a rock ledge (6.35 miles : 10,712'). Maintain navigational vigilance and recollection over rock slabs leading to and past this mark. The trail drops through a cluttered forest to Upper Cataract Creek, a voluminous body that requires careful fording (6.85 miles : 10,528'). The pickup is once again vague on the far side, however the creek - which is Mirror Lake's outlet - provides intuitive guidance in the event you lose track. Travel moderates to the northeast shore of Mirror Lake (7.02 miles : 10,559'). Its south shore is hemmed by the steep flank of Eagles Nest Peak (13,091'), but its long, contoured north shore is fairly easy to explore. Those with time and good navigational skills will find a string of four small lakes just northwest of Mirror Lake.",106.683333333
293,Tipperary Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,10.25,8605,9768,1163,4,True,"The Surprise Trailhead is located 25 miles northwest of Silverthorne, CO in the Eagles Nest Wilderness. Tipperary Lake is one of six lakes accessible in a day from the Surprise trail network.  It fills a large, marshy basin along Cataract Creek. Visitors will enjoy abundant wildflowers, diverse forests and good camping and fishing at Tipperary Lake: The Surprise Trail rises steadily through aspen-studded hillsides on a S-SE heading to the Eagles Nest Wilderness Boundary (.27 miles : 8,725'). Wildflowers are notably abundant and diverse on this initial stretch, but expect some of the hike's steepest grades on the first two miles. The trail passes through a large aspen grove (.8 miles) to a stream crossing on a makeshift bridge (1.0 mile : 9,135'); once over it steepens beside a long, slender meadow into a mixed lodgepole, spruce and fir. Though badly marred by pine beetles, deadfall has cleared space for new growth and verdant ground cover. Look for wildlife in small clearings along the way. The steep climb continues over a second creek (2.4 miles : 9,905') before easing to the Gore Range Trail split (2.7 miles : 9,953'). Follow signs to Surprise Lake (2.9 miles : 10,044'). Surprise Lake is partially concealed by thick timber and marshy bands between the trail and north shore. Dora Mountain (12,292') reflects in this small, lily covered lake. The trail keeps west past the Upper Cataract Trail split (3.45 miles : 10,387'), crests, and tilts downhill on a shifting, oft-obstructed path. Note a markedly healthier forest as you progress on a steady westerly heading. The grade steepens past 4.5 miles to the Tipperary Lake Trail split (5.0 miles : 9,863'). Anticipate this sign, as it's easy to miss. The access trail twists .12 miles down a vague and rugged path to the south shore of Tipperary Lake (5.12 miles : 9,768'). The Tipperary Lake basin is large, open and marshy. The best views across the lake and of Eagles Nest Peak (13,091') are on the east shore, but to reach it you must either negotiate a cumbersome forest social trail, or tread the lake's marshy perimeter. If unconcerned about getting wet, the latter is much quicker. Suitable camping terrain can be found just off the access trail on the lake's SW edge, one of few bands of terra firma along the shore. You may also find private locations on the north and northeast shores nestled in a string of rock slabs.",106.683333333
294,Upper Cataract Lake and Cat Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,10.9,8605,10744,2139,4,True,"The Surprise Trailhead is located 25 miles northwest of Silverthorne, CO in the Eagles Nest Wilderness. It provides access to a string of subalpine lakes of varying distance and difficulty, prized for their backcountry camping, fishing and solitude.  Upper Cataract Lake and Cat Lake are connected by an outlet stream below Eagles Nest Peak (13,091'), the eponymous summit of this wilderness area. Visitors will enjoy diverse forests, abundant wildflowers and large lake basins to explore at Upper Cataract Lake and Cat Lake: The Surprise Trail rises steadily through aspen-studded hillsides on a S-SE heading to the Eagles Nest Wilderness Boundary (.27 miles : 8,725'). Wildflowers are exceptional on these steep first two miles. Look for bear, elk and moose in grassy clearings along the way. The trail passes through a large aspen grove (.8 miles) to a stream and makeshift bridge (1.0 mile : 9,135'). Once over it steepens beside a long, slender meadow. Though the forest has been badly affected by beetle kill, deadfall has cleared space for new growth and verdant ground cover. The steep, steady climb continues over a second creek (2.4 miles : 9,905') and eases to the Gore Range Trail split (2.7 miles : 9,953'). Follow signs to Surprise Lake (2.9 miles : 10,044'). Surprise Lake is partially concealed by thick timber and marshy bands between the trail and north shore. Dora Mountain (12,292') reflects in this small, lily covered lake. The trail keeps west across several small streams to the Upper Cataract Trail split (3.45 miles : 10,387'). Veer SW on the Upper Cataract Trail into a markedly healthier forest, and arguably the hike's most pleasant stretch. The trail rises gently and shifts frequently to its highest point (5.0 miles : 10,890'), then drops sharply to a talus field at the base of Eagles Nest Peak (5.15 miles : 10,825'). It twists around the talus with great views of Cat Lake down to the Upper Cataract Lake split (5.35 miles : 10,725'). A short spur leads to the NE shore of Upper Cataract Lake (5.45 miles : 10,744'). Upper Cataract Lake is large and contoured, ringed with pockets of timber, open space and marsh. To reach Cat Lake, backtrack to the Upper Cataract Lake split and continue.1 mile west to the access spur on the right. Anticipate this split, as the sign is fairly hidden. The spur drops steeply to the south shore of Cat Lake (5.6 miles : 10,395'), which is thickly wooded but easy to explore.",106.683333333
295,Cataract Loop Trail,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,2.25,8652,8652,152,1,True,"Lower Cataract Lake is located 25 miles northwest of Silverthorne, CO in the Eagles Nest Wilderness Area. The Cataract Loop Trail circles the lake on mild terrain that's well suited for families, runners, anglers and winter recreation.  Though short, visitors will enjoy diverse ecotones that include open sage fields, thick aspen groves, dense spruce-fir forests and leafy riparian zones around the lake and its inlet stream. Three paths emanate from the Lower Cataract Lake Loop Trailhead. The left and right forks follow the loop trail, while the middle provides direct access to the lake. The following description follows the left fork and travels clockwise around the lake: The Cataract Loop Trail drops across the outlet stream and rises up the lake's southeast shore with good views of aspen-sage studded hillsides to the north. It officially enters the Eagles Nest Wilderness Area (.17 miles : 8,644') and levels on a SW heading above the lake through open scrub. The trail is gradually enveloped by columns of spruce as it wraps around the lake's west side and enters a notably tall pine forest (1.0 miles : 8,661'). The trail shifts quickly through dark timber to a long bridge spanning Lower Cataract Lake's primary inlet (1.2 miles : 8,684'), born from Tipperary Lake directly to the south. It soon emerges on the lake's marshy west shore, a good place to see waterfowl. The trail bends northeast (1.5 miles : 8,666') and undulates to the loop's highest point (8,805') with excellent views across the lake basin and a glimpse of some of the Gore Range's tallest peaks. Travel moderates along the north shore through a diverting stretch of aspen, some of considerably size and girth. The trail merges with a private road (2.1 miles : 8,704') and glides gently back to the trailhead to complete the loop (2.25 miles : 8,652').",108.016666667
296,McCullough Gulch Trail,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,2.7,11105,11915,810,3,True,"The McCullough Gulch Trail is located 2.2 miles west of Highway 9 on the north side of Quandary Peak. It follows an old mining road .5 miles up the drainage before splitting off on a rugged path to White Falls and Upper Blue Reservoir.  This spectacular lake has a long, open shore with many good vantages and nooks to explore. McCullough Gulch is a deservingly popular trail, especially among anglers and active families. Arrive early to secure parking and avoid crowds. Upper Blue Reservoir is the first of several accessible lakes in the McCullough Creek drainage. A challenging but reasonably well-defined route continues into the capacious upper valley, where intuitive routing through expansive alpine meadows leads to over six additional lakes and tarns: The trail begins on a steep mining road that rises along the creek to a fork, where you'll veer left onto a rocky, rooted path (.5 miles : 11,440'). It shifts frequently and braids in several places, however signs provide ample guidance. The trail crosses a short talus field at .95 miles (11,580'), just past which are consecutive splits for the White Falls Loop (1.0 miles : 11,597'). This short excursion leads to good views of the falls and returns to the main trail. Travel continues steeply through treeline to an unmarked fork (1.3 miles); go left to reach the lake's outlet area, or keep straight to the north shore (1.35 miles : 11,915'). Those with time should explore both access points, as they lead to different views of this deceptively long and shapely lake. To reach the upper valley, follow the main trail along the north shore. It undulates ruggedly over outcrops and several marshy inlet streams to the far west side (1.6 miles : 12,006'), where you'll begin a steep, twisting climb that generally traces the lake's main inlet falls. Though at first obfuscated by brush, the route clarifies and is well-marked by cairns once you get going. Look for mountain goat along the way, which are fairly common in this area. The landscape naturally funnels you to the top of the waterfall, where it suddenly levels by a tarn and opens dramatically in the upper valley (2.1 miles : 12,415'). The path continues west and eventually fades in open tundra, but it's hardly necessary at this point. The first lake is located straight ahead at about 2.55 miles (12,555'). It's fairly easy to navigate by sight up to the lake just behind it, which lies in a deep cirque that's typically iced-over through mid-summer (3.15 miles : 12,785').",114.283333333
297,Wheeler Trail to Mohawk Lakes,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,8.3,10975,12073,1098,4,True,"Mohawk Lake is located 4.15 miles from McCullough Gulch via the Wheeler National Recreation Trail, which stretches over 10 miles S-N across the Ten Mile Range. Though most hikers access Mohawk Lake from Spruce Creek Trailhead, this longer alternative enjoys light crowds and additional wildlife viewing opportunities on the steep up-down traverse between the McCullough Gulch and Spruce Creek drainages.  The Wheeler Trail joins the Spruce Creek Trail after 2.3 miles, which turns west past Continental Falls, historic mining cabins and Lower Mohawk Lake to Mohawk Lake. An unimproved route continues above Mohawk Lake through expansive alpine meadows to five more spectacular lakes in the upper valley: The Wheeler Trail begins on the north side of McCullough Gulch with a terrific look at Quandary Peak (14,265'), the tallest peak in the Ten Mile Range. It climbs steeply through a patchy subalpine forest along an east-facing slope to a crest (.55 miles : 11,503'), where grades moderate with good views of the Boreas Pass area. The trail drops gradually then steeply into a thick spruce-fir forest leading to the Spruce Creek Trail split on the edge of a large marshy meadow (2.3 miles : 10,965'). The Spruce Creek Trail turns west beside the meadow up to Spruce Creek Road, (2.8 miles : 11,120'), which you'll follow to its terminus at a water utility station. Cross the dam and follow signs (right) off the road to resume the trail (2.9 miles). Travel steepens to the Mayflower Lakes split (3.15 miles : 11,285') and crosses a creek, past which the trail braids in several places. These social trails typically lead to views of Continental Falls, mining remains or established campsites - and in most cases link back to the main trail artery. Do your best to stay on track, and avoid trampling sensitive vegetation. The trail twists steeply by a mining cabin to a marked split for Lower Continental Falls Vista (3.35 miles : 11,385'). It follows a useful mining cable past the falls split up open rock, moderating to the edge of Lower Mohawk Lake (3.75 miles : 11,810'). Lower Mohawk Lake lies at treeline below Mount Helen (13,164'), a fine stopping point if limited by time or weather. Continental Falls pour from its outlet, and there's plenty of shoreline to explore. The trail continues along the shore before breaking away on a twisting (and braided) climb through treeline to Mohawk Lake (4.15 miles : 12,073'). Mohawk Lake fills a large circular bowl with scalable walls and a tight but navigable shoreline. Large cutthroat trout are abundant, and you'll likely find anglers ringing the lake. A well-traveled route continues up Mohawk's north side into the dramatically wide upper valley, capped by Pacific Peak (13,950'), Crystal Peak (13,852') and Father Dyer Peak (13,615'). It skirts a small lake (4.35 miles : 12,219') and continues across relatively flat open tundra to three more - 4.7 miles (12,334'), 5.05 miles (12,372') and 5.35 miles (12,438'). A fifth - Pacific Tarn - requires a steep, rocky climb with no discernable route past the fourth lake.",113.316666667
298,Eccles Pass,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,10.25,9157,11917,2760,4,True,"Eccles Pass is located in the Eagles Nest Wilderness north of Frisco, CO. Eccles Pass straddles a divisive ridge between the Meadow Creek drainage (south), and South Willow Creek basin (north).  This high vantage provides commanding views across each, and distant peaks of the Gore and Ten Mile ranges. After a steady climb through dense forest, the landscape opens across stunning alpine meadows leading up to Eccles Pass: The Meadow Creek Trail winds through an aspen-pine forest to the Lily Pad Lake Trail split and bends northeast (.57 miles : 9,560'). It widens on a variously soft and rocky path through columns of lodgepole to Meadow Creek (1.35 miles : 10,036'), resuming a methodical climb once across. At 2.5 miles (10,764') the trail narrows in a transitional forest where lodgepole give way to spruce and fir in the high subalpine. The forest briefly opens with a glimpse of the upper valley (2.65 miles : 10,835'), and presses steeply to a crest over the first of three large meadows (2.95 miles : 10,988'). The trail drops and undulates ruggedly up the wooded south edge of the first and smallest meadow, crossing Meadow Creek once on a makeshift bridge. Large side pools in the vicinity are particularly good for angling. The thinning forest breaks on the edge of a second, much larger meadow with a revealing look at the entire upper valley (3.6 miles : 11,128'). Chief Mountain (11,377') stands prominently to the south, and Eccles Pass can now be seen to the northwest. This terrain is ideal for camping, though fire regulations near treeline now apply (see guidelines below). The trail levels into the third and largest meadow (3.95 miles : 11,235'), which leads back over Meadow Creek (4.15 miles : 11,305'). The path is intermittently faint but intuitively followed to the Meadow Creek - Gore Range Trail junction (4.45 miles : 11,422'), with Eccles Pass clearly visible in the northwest corner of the valley. The Gore Range Trail bears right and winds steeply up to Eccles Pass (5.12 miles : 11,918') with exceptional views down Meadow Creek valley, and north across Red Peak (13,189'), Buffalo Mountain (12,777') and South Willow Creek basin. The Gore Range Trail drops from Eccles Pass and continues north to Red Buffalo Pass (11,742'), a major east-west route between Silverthorne and Vail. Those with time should consider this relatively short excursion (about 3 miles roundtrip), which runs across gorgeous alpine benches and by several small lakes to the pass. An informal trail extends east from Eccles Pass along a thin spine to Buffalo Mountain.",74.9166666667
299,Frisco to Vail Thru Hike,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,13.55,9157,8721,-436,4,True,"The Meadow Creek Trail (6.6 miles) and Gore Creek Trail (7.0 miles) form a 13.6 mile thru-hike from Frisco to Vail. The route passes through big alpine meadows and scales two gorgeous passes en route - Eccles Pass (11,917') and Red Buffalo Pass (11,742'). Visitors will enjoy miles of alpine travel and abundant wildflowers on this challenging and varied trek:  The Meadow Creek Trail winds through an aspen-pine forest to the Lily Pad Lake Trail split and bends northeast (.57 miles : 9,560'). It widens on a variously soft and rocky path to Meadow Creek (1.35 miles : 10,036'), crosses, and resumes a methodical climb through uniform lodgepole. At 2.5 miles (10,764') the trail transitions into the high subalpine with a glimpse of the upper valley (2.65 miles : 10,835'). It continues steeply to a crest overlooking the first of three large meadows below Eccles Pass (2.95 miles : 10,988'). Look for moose and elk in the meadows, and mountain goat on higher slopes and ridges. The trail undulates ruggedly up the wooded south edge of the first and smallest meadow, crossing Meadow Creek once on a shoddy bridge. The forest breaks on the edge of a second, much larger meadow with good views of the upper valley (3.6 miles : 11,128'). Chief Mountain (11,377') stands prominently to the south, and Eccles Pass can now be seen to the northwest. This terrain is particularly good for camping, though fires are restricted near treeline. Travel eases in a thinning forest to the third and largest meadow (3.95 miles : 11,235'). A short climb leads back over Meadow Creek (4.15 miles : 11,305') and levels to the Meadow Creek - Gore Range Trail junction (4.45 miles : 11,422'). Bear right toward Eccles Pass. The trail winds steeply up to Eccles Pass (5.12 miles : 11,917') with long views back down valley, and northerly panoramas of Red Peak (13,189'), Buffalo Mountain (12,777') and South Willow Creek basin. It drops north from Eccles Pass and skirts the bottom of a talus slide to a long alpine bench connecting the passes (5.5 miles : 11,690'). This stunning segment is dotted with tarns and carpeted in wildflowers. The trail rolls gently past two ponds (5.75 miles : 11,568' - 6.0 miles : 11,448'), then tilts up for a short but steep push to Red Buffalo Pass (6.6 miles : 11,742'). The trail fades again on top of the pass and is difficult to find. From the pass, head .12 miles south and look downhill (west) for cairns. Note the trail does not travel down the north side of the valley. Locate cairns - which are fairly small - and head downhill. A narrow but clear path soon emerges in the grass, bending sharply south .25 miles from the pass (6.85 miles : 11,589'). The downhill grade is very steep, and challenging even when dry. Travel moderates as you near the valley floor west of Red Buffalo Pass, but still requires vigilance on vague segments (7.35 miles : 11,045'). The trail flattens through a large meadow and crosses the headwaters of Gore Creek, a modest trickle at this point (7.5 miles : 10,956'). Here a cluttered forest reclaims the shifting trail down the south bank of Gore Creek. Look for wildlife - especially deer, elk, moose, and bear - in meadows 1.25 miles and 1.6 miles from the pass. The trail edges down to Gore Creek, which must be crossed (9.35 miles : 10,194'). Though this point is unmarked, you can locate the Gore Lake Trail split in a clearing just over the creek and use that for guidance. The trail resumes west down the north bank of Gore Creek. This rugged 4.2 mile segment leading to Vail is highlighted by aspen groves, flowers and large clearings in the valley. Aspen are more abundant past a bridge crossing at 11.8 miles (9,517'). The trail crosses the Eagles Nest Wilderness Boundary (13.15 miles) on the final run down to the Gore Creek Trailhead in east Vail (13.55 miles : 8,721').",74.9166666667
300,Willow Falls,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,8.7,9237,10020,783,3,True,"Willow Falls is located along South Willow Creek, just west of Silverthorne, CO in the Eagles Nest Wilderness. South Willow Creek forms on the slopes connecting Eccles Pass and Red Buffalo Pass, flowing east through a narrow gap between Buffalo Mountain's steep north flank, and Red Peak's long east ridge.  This tiered cascade is tucked in a thick pine forest just off the Gore Range Trail; the upper fills a shallow pool, and the lower drops through a granite chute and expands in a meadow below Buffalo Mountain. The following route connects the Mesa Cortina and Gore Range trails, a versatile 3-4 season route. Mild grades and good trail conditions are suitable for families, backpackers, runners and winter recreation: The Mesa Cortina Trail heads north through aspen - sage flats framed by Buffalo Mountain (12,777') and Red Peak (13,189') to the west, and Ptarmigan Peak (12,498') and the Williams Fork Mountains (east).It steepens past the Eagles Nest Wilderness Boundary (.77 miles : 9,235') in a busy forest floor of yellow arnica, fireweed and deadfall. The trail dips across a tributary and veers left past a marked spur with no public access (2.25 miles : 9,433'). Here the Mesa Cortina Trail is joined by another unmarked trail that begins in downtown Silverthorne. It continues on mild grades to South Willow Creek, just over which is the Gore Range Trail junction (2.75 miles : 9,425'). Bear left (west) on the GRT. The GRT winds up the north bank of South Willow Creek through expanding glades and a string of larger marshes and ponds hidden between the trail and creek. Look for moose in this area. The path grows rugged and narrows into the slot between Buffalo Mountain and Red Peak's east ridge, climbing steadily to the Buffalo Cabin Connector Trail split (3.85 miles : 9,640'). It continues west on a steeper grade to the Willow Falls Trail split (4.3 miles : 10,035'), which branches left on an unmaintained but clear path to rock slabs bisecting the falls (4.35 miles : 10,020). The midsection of Willow Falls are easy to cross, and social trails run up and down either side. Those with time should consider continuing on to Red Buffalo Pass, an additional 3.25 miles from the falls.",75.8833333333
301,Fancy Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,5.4,10017,11540,1523,3,True,"Fancy Lake (11,540') is located 2.7 miles from Homestake Road in the Holy Cross Wilderness. It fills a steep-walled bowl at treeline, and is one of many highlights on the Missouri Pass - Fancy Pass Loop. The Fancy Creek Trail rises quickly in a moss-draped forest to the lake, and continues on a challenging .7 mile, 888' climb to Fancy Pass (12,390'). While the Fancy Lake basin is more confined than the Missouri Lakes basin, backpackers will enjoy privacy among knolls that ring the lake, and in thick forests just below it: The trail crosses the Holy Cross Wilderness Boundary (.2 miles) and undulates to Zen Bridge over Fancy Creek (.85 miles : 10,445'). The bridge is elevated and can be slippery; in some cases it may be easier/safer to cross in the water. Here it begins a steady climb through a pleasant (if nondescript) forest to a large clearing and vaguely marked creek crossing (2.18 miles : 11,145'). The trail closely follows the creek to this point, but is largely concealed by timber. It crosses the creek and steepens considerably on a corkscrew-like path to the open east shore of Fancy Lake (2.7 miles : 11,540'). Note portions of the trail can be faint on this final approach. Fancy Lake is fairly walled-in, but social trails lead around the bowl to interesting nooks and tall knolls. The trail twists past the lake and crosses back over the creek to the Holy Cross City Trail split (2.8 miles : 11,560'). The Fancy Creek Trail clears treeline on a steep climb into the tapered upper valley. Even if not aiming for the pass, it's worth reaching this point for great aerial views of the lake. The trail is funneled into a narrow, boulder-lined chute below jagged crags to Fancy Pass (3.4 miles : 12,390'). Snow can make this strenuous approach even more difficult; traction devices are often useful. Views from the pass, a small notch on the south end of the Holy Cross Ridge, are stunning. The trail drops from the pass into the Treasure Vault Lake basin and joins the Missouri Lake Trail to form an 8.8 mile loop.",150.966666667
302,Missouri Lakes,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,7.0,10010,11502,1492,3,True,"The Missouri Lakes are located 3.5 miles from Homestake Road in the Holy Cross Wilderness. They occupy an idyllic alpine basin below Missouri Pass (11,986') in the heart of the Sawatch Range.  The lakes sit at and just above treeline in a gentle expanse dotted with ponds, streams and tree-topped knolls. The area's mild terrain is ideal for camping, fishing and extended exploration. The Missouri Lakes are deservingly one of the most popular destinations in the Holy Cross, and highlight the venerable Missouri Pass - Fancy Pass Loop: The trail begins on a mild grade that steepens past .5 miles to a wide section of creek at the Holy Cross Wilderness Boundary (.93 miles : 10,360'). It narrows in a thick forest up to a bridge over the creek (1.1 miles : 10,468'), where you can divert to a series of scenic cascades just upstream. Grades pick up considerably past the bridge along the rim of a deep, narrow gorge. Exercise caution when viewing the creek from above on these deceptively slippery rock slabs. The trail crosses back over the creek (1.35 miles) and levels around a large, marshy meadow with views of Savage Peak and a diverse collection of flowers (1.5 miles : 10,805'). It circles the meadow and funnels into the upper gorge right along the creek (2.0 miles : 10,987'), then moderates away in a thinning subalpine forest (2.5 miles : 11,170'). Look for a sparingly marked social trail between 2.7-2.8 miles that veers SW (left) along a creek to the first Missouri Lake. This is a compelling destination that few visitors see, and great choice for backpackers on busy weekends. The main trail continues on variously rugged and moderate intervals into the upper valley where the landscape opens to Lower Missouri Lake (3.15 miles : 11,410'). Gentle terrain, ponds and streams complement this picturesque setting. It pitches up through treeline to Upper Missouri Lake (3.5 miles : 11,502') in a wide, level basin below Missouri Pass. Social trails fan around the lake and to various campsites; veer left and hug the shore to reach the pass. The designated trail undulates clockwise across the inlet stream to a large tarn (3.85 miles : 11,535'), a highlight sometimes ignored in favor of the pass. It levels by the tarn before turning sharply on a demanding .5 mile, 450' push to Missouri Pass (4.35 miles : 11,986').",151.033333333
303,Missouri Pass - Fancy Pass Loop,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,8.8,10010,12390,2380,4,True,"The Missouri Lakes and Fancy Creek trails form an 8.8 mile loop highlighted by several lakes and airy alpine landscapes between Missouri Pass (11,986') and Fancy Pass (12,390'). This feature-filled hike is one of the most popular backpacking routes in the Holy Cross, with access to the Missouri Lakes, Treasure Vault Lake, Fancy Lake and numerous tarns above treeline. Terrain is generally moderate, but two steep pass climbs and descents give this a more difficult rating. The following description begins on the Missouri Lakes Trail and travels clockwise on the loop: The trail begins on a mild grade that steepens past .5 miles to the Holy Cross Wilderness Boundary (.93 miles : 10,360'). It rises to a bridge over the creek (1.1 miles : 10,468'), where grades pick up considerably along the rim of a deep, narrow gorge. The trail crosses back over the creek (1.35 miles) and levels around a large, marshy meadow with views of Savage Peak and a diverse collection of flowers (1.5 miles : 10,805').

The main trail continues on variously rugged and moderate intervals into the upper valley, where the landscape opens to Lower Missouri Lake (3.15 miles : 11,410'). Gentle terrain, ponds and streams complement this idyllic setting. It pitches up through treeline to Upper Missouri Lake in a wide, level basin below the pass (3.5 miles : 11,502'). Turn left and follow the shore clockwise. The trail undulates around the lake and over the inlet to a large tarn (3.85 miles : 11,535'), where it turns sharply on a 450' - .5 mile climb to Missouri Pass (4.35 miles : 11,986'). Views from the pass are stunning, highlighted by Treasure Vault Lake, Blodgett Lake and distant Middle Mountain ridge. The trail drops quickly off the pass through high alpine meadows to the Cross Creek Trail - Fancy Creek Trail junction (4.7 miles : 11,802'). Treasure Vault Lake is an easy .4 mile roundtrip excursion, but be mindful of time and weather with one more pass to climb. Also note that trails may be faint leading to and past the intersection; a good map and understanding of the route will help avoid confusion. The Fancy Creek Trail turns toward Fancy Pass, a rocky notch in the NE corner of the basin. It rises gently across rolling slopes, then steepens over talus up to Fancy Pass (5.45 miles : 12,390'). Views once again are exceptional, with a chance to survey the markedly steeper descent into the Fancy Creek drainage. The drainage is quite different from the Missouri side, notably narrower, deeper and topped by rugged crags. The trail drops sharply through a rocky chute that gradually moderates to the edge of treeline with great views over Fancy Lake. It reaches the Holy Cross City Trail split at 6.05 miles (11,560'), turns right across a creek and twists down to the open east side of Fancy Lake (6.15 miles : 11,540'). The lake fills a steep-walled bowl at treeline, which takes a little more effort to explore than the Missouri cluster. The trail continues steeply from Fancy Lake on tightly wound corkscrews into a thick forest. Pay close attention on this fast, shifting descent. Travel gradually moderates to a sloping meadow and a vaguely marked creek crossing at 6.67 miles (11,145'). Anticipate this point, as it's easy to miss. Travel clarifies once over the creek on a much steadier descent through a pleasant (if nondescript) forest. It's generally removed from the creek before crossing a wide section of it on Zen Bridge (8.0 miles : 10,455'). The bridge can be slippery, especially with a heavy pack. The trail undulates past the bridge up to the Holy Cross Wilderness Boundary (8.6 miles), and down to the Fancy Creek Trailhead to complete the loop (8.8 miles : 10,017').",151.033333333
304,Treasure Vault Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,9.8,10010,11675,1665,4,True,"Treasure Vault Lake is located 4.9 miles from Missouri Lakes Trailhead in the Holy Cross Wilderness. The lake sits above treeline in a spectacular basin just west of Missouri Pass.  Though it's an easy excursion from the Missouri Pass - Fancy Pass Loop, an out-and-back hike offers more time in the Treasure Vault and Missouri Lakes basins, which are arguably more compelling than the Fancy Creek side. Blodgett Lake (11,665') is accessible from Treasure Vault by way of a cross-country route that follows relatively level topo lines across steep valley walls to a cirque in the west corner of the basin: The trail begins on a mild grade that steepens past .5 miles to the Holy Cross Wilderness Boundary (.93 miles : 10,360'). It rises to a bridge over the creek (1.1 miles : 10,468'), where grades pick up considerably along the rim of a deep, narrow gorge. The trail crosses back over the creek (1.35 miles) and levels around a large, marshy meadow (1.5 miles : 10,805'). It circles the meadow and funnels into the upper gorge right along the creek (2.0 miles : 10,987'), then moderates away in a thinning forest (2.5 miles : 11,170'). The main trail continues on variously rugged and moderate intervals into the upper valley where the landscape opens to Lower Missouri Lake (3.15 miles : 11,410'). It pitches up through treeline to Upper Missouri Lake in a wide, level basin below the pass (3.5 miles : 11,502'). Turn left and follow the shore clockwise. The trail undulates around the lake and over the inlet to a large tarn (3.85 miles : 11,535'), where it turns sharply on a 450' - .5 mile climb to Missouri Pass (4.35 miles : 11,986'). Views of Treasure Vault Lake are exceptional, and the x-country route to Blodgett Lake becomes clear. The trail drops quickly off the pass through high alpine meadows to the Cross Creek Trail - Fancy Creek Trail junction (4.7 miles : 11,802'), where a spur branches down to the west side of Treasure Vault Lake (4.92 miles : 11,675'). Follow the outlet stream to great views over the Cross Creek drainage, and to begin your route to Blodgett Lake. Glass the basin for elk, and ridges above for bighorn sheep and mountain goat.",151.033333333
305,Mt Evans,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,5.8,12830,14264,1434,4,True,"Mt Evans (14,264') is the 14th highest peak in Colorado, and closest fourteener to the Denver metro area. While the summit is accessible by car, there are also several hiking routes of varying length and difficulty leading to it.  One route begins at Summit Lake and climbs 1,400' in 2.9 miles to Mt Evans. Visitors will enjoy a relatively moderate trek through open tundra with excellent wildlife viewing throughout. Surprisingly, hiking routes to Mt Evans are absent from many popular maps. View this map for the route, which scales the Summit Lake cirque to Mt Spalding, then over Lake Abyss to Mt Evans: The trail skirts Summit Lake to the Chicago Lakes - Mt Evans Trail split (.2 miles) with long views down the glacially carved Chicago Creek Valley. The Mt Evans Trail banks left and climbs steeply with several short rock scrambles to the top of the Summit Lake cirque basin (1.0 miles : 13,717'). Here travel moderates in open tundra with panoramas that include Grays and Torreys, Mt Bierstadt and the Chicago and Summit Lake basins. The trail rises to a crest just behind Mt Spalding (1.2 miles : 13,830') and drops to a low point in a broad saddle (1.5 miles : 13,621'). A good line of cairns mark the trail, but blend seamlessly into the landscape. Keep track of your progress, as the faint trail can be difficult to follow. The trail climbs steeply from the nadir to a crest (2.0 miles : 13,960'), and wraps around the southwest side of Mt Evans with commanding views over the Abyss Lake basin, Mt Bierstadt, and Sawtooth. The trail crosses 14,000 at 2.1 miles, but undulates ruggedly through large boulders with little net gain over the next half mile. Travel slows through this uneven section until reaching the Mt Evans Road (2.85 miles : 14,169'), just before which switchbacks break left to the Mt Evans summit (2.9 miles : 14,264'). Views are sensational, but the mountain goats and bighorn sheep that frequent the summit pavilion may be of even greater interest. Enjoy wildlife from a safe distance.",80.6666666667
306,Mt Goliath Natural Area,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,2.8,11540,12132,540,2,True,"The Mt Goliath Natural Area is located 16.5 miles south of Idaho Springs on the Mt Evans Scenic Byway. It protects the largest, northernmost stand of Bristlecone Pine trees in North America, and is internationally recognized as one of the purest locations to study alpine ecology.  The bristlecone of Mt Goliath are found in large quantities because of conducive conditions on dry, south-facing slopes over 11,000'. They include some of the oldest trees in Colorado, ranging from 1600 to 2500 years old. Bristlecone pine have unique adaptations to survive the alpine tundra's persistent winds, high elevation, low moisture, cold temperatures and short growing seasons: 	The bristlecone pine's short, twisted trunk facilitates nutrient flow, and stabilizes the tree in strong winds (vs. a long, narrow trunk that could snap).  	Flexible branches bend in the wind, rather than break.  	Slow growth rates: Bristlecones may take a century to add just 1 inch in diameter, and can become nearly dormant during a drought.  	Trees replace needles once every 10-15 years rather than annually, which conserves energy.  	Narrow growth rings create dense wood that's resistant to insects and disease. The tree's resin also combats insects and disease.  Strip-barking enables a small strip of bark to nourish large branches and needle clusters. Lack of nutrient competition and the absence of fire also contribute to the trees' longevity. While bristlecone pines highlight this area, it also supports localized micro-climates with plants found nowhere else below the Arctic Circle - one would have to travel 3,000 miles north to see the same plant communities. The Pesman Trail runs 1.4 miles and climbs 592' through these distinct plant communities and the heart of the bristlecone pine forest. The Bristlecone Loop and Alpine Loop offer short extensions through the forest and open tundra (respectively). Mountain goat, bighorn sheep, elk, marmot, ptarmigan and various raptors can be seen throughout the year. Plants of the Alpine Tundra Alpine tundra plants grow close to the ground to minimize wind exposure, have small fleshy leaves with waxy surfaces to facilitate water conservation, often have hairy leaves for additional warmth, and sometimes have red stems to prevent sunburn. They're also perennials, which use the same root system each year. Some, like the Spring Beauty, entrench themselves in rocky crevices and grow a long, thick taproot to stabilize the plant and access moisture deep underground. Lichens are comprised of two organisms: a fungus that gives it structure, and an algae within the fungus that stores water and gives it color. Lichens need only a rock, sunlight, and some water every few years to survive. A one inch diameter lichen may be hundreds of years old; some lichens can live for thousands of years. Lichens help turn rock into soil by secreting acids that dissolve it into minerals. Cushion and mat plants help build soil by capturing organic debris in their foliage, plots in which grasses and taller plants can eventually root. This turns fellfield into alpine turf, a process that can take centuries.",66.0333333333
307,Pitkin Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,8.9,8476,11362,2886,5,True,"Pitkin Lake is located 4.45 miles north of Vail in the Eagles Nest Wilderness Area. It fills a large cirque just above treeline at the head of a broad, glacier-carved valley. Visitors will enjoy varied scenery along several staged climbs into the upper valley, where the landscape opens to rolling alpine meadows on the approach to Pitkin Lake.  The trail crosses Pitkin Creek and begins a strenuous climb on a narrow, aspen-lined path. Grades moderate past .3 miles (8,955') on a grassy slope between thick aspen stands and the creek. Travel steadies up a widening valley, introducing lodgepole, spruce and fir as you progress (1.0 miles : 9,302'). It joins the creek for a moment (1.5 miles : 9,516') before climbing steeply to a crest overlooking a wide berth in the valley, a good place to scan for wildlife (1.85 miles : 9,765'). The trail drops down the west side, bottoms out (2.0 miles : 9,715'), and climbs ruggedly out of the meadow with great views back down valley, and NE toward Pitkin Falls (2.5 miles : 10,087). Travel intensifies to the base of a rockslide (2.7 miles : 10,272'), then makes another short, steep burst to a second crest over a large meadow where a major tributary joins Pitkin Creek (2.95 miles : 10,420'). Cross the meadow and begin a strenuous climb up the far side through a dense spruce-fir forest. Be mindful of false spurs along this shifting segment. The trail moderates on the edge of a thinning forest (3.35 miles : 10,765'), relaxing for a spell through small clearings and spruce stands. Another short, steep push to 3.8 miles (10,975') moderates in a transitional forest beneath towering, sculpted walls of the upper valley. The trail bends northwest through an expanding alpine landscape and shoots up the valley's west side through the vestiges of treeline (4.0 miles : 11,072'). It scales a ridge and edges back to the valley center (4.25 miles : 11,277'), where it levels beside Pitkin Creek to the south edge of Pitkin Lake (4.45 miles : 11,362'). The Pitkin Lake basin is immense and, to see it all, you'll have to climb a bit up its southeast or southwest shore. From these points you'll also have great views back down valley that reveal hidden meadows, ponds and streams.",95.1
308,Ptarmigan Peak,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,12.0,9155,12498,3343,5,True,"Ptarmigan Peak (12,498') straddles the Summit County - Grand County line in the Ptarmigan Peak Wilderness near Silverthorne CO. This strenuous trail climbs over 3300' in 6 miles to a broad, flat summit with panoramic views across the Williams Fork, Gore and Ten Mile ranges. Visible peaks include Buffalo Mountain, Red Peak, Grays Peak, Torreys Peak and Longs Peak. The trail heads north from the parking lot to a private road @ .1 miles. Turn left and walk 100 yards up the road to a sign for the Ptarmigan Trail pointing right. The Ptarmigan Trail crosses a sagebrush hillside to a Ptarmigan Peak Wilderness Information Board (.7 miles : 9,617'); note the official boundary is still 3.7 miles and 1890' up from this point. It drops under power lines (1.0 miles : 9,560') and rises across two small streams into a dense aspen forest for the next mile. The trail briefly opens with views of Buffalo Mountain and Red Peak before re-entering timber to the Angler Trail junction (2.0 miles : 9,868'). The trail continues north on a steady climb through 10,000' as aspen cede to spruce and fir. Grades steepen through 3.0 miles (10,425') on a northwest bend toward the summit. It crosses 11,000' (3.75 miles) and reaches treeline at the Ptarmigan Peak Wilderness Boundary (4.4 miles : 11,500'). The trail heads northwest across open tundra with exceptional views to the Ptarmigan Pass split (4.9 miles : 11,888').

309,Quandary Peak,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,6.2,10937,14265,3328,5,True,"Quandary Peak (14,265') is located 7.6 miles south of Breckenridge, Colorado in the Dillon Ranger District of the White River National Forest. Quandary Peak is the highest point in Colorado's Tenmile Range, and 13th among the state's 14ers.  It's considered among the easiest 14ers to reach for its modest distance and well built trail. Still, the 3300' climb in just 3.1 miles is no small task, and rocky terrain will challenge even the fittest hikers. Visitors will enjoy exceptional views that extend across the Mosquito, Gore and Sawatch ranges: The trail climbs steadily across two marked jeep roads to your first glimpse of Quandary Peak, Hoosier Pass, and distant peaks of the Tenmile Range (.85 mile - 1.0 mile). It clears treeline and wraps to the south face of Quandary Peak's east ridge (1.0 miles : 11,721'). Here you'll have views of the Blue Lakes, Monte Cristo Creek and North Star Mountain looming high on the Continental Divide. The relatively even, dirt path to this point transitions to rugged talus on a steep, winding climb up the southeast flank of Quandary Peak (1.25 miles : 11,975'). Climbing intensifies to Quandary's well-defined E-W spine. The trail blends easily into the landscape, but is well-marked by cairns and intuitively followed when not. It levels briefly along the east ridge across a wide tundra bench at the base of Quandary Peak (2.15 miles : 13,102'). Here you'll have big views down McCullough Gulch, south across the Continental Divide and due west up the formidable and final summit push. Look for mountain goat along nearby ridges, and moose and elk in the adjacent valleys. At 2.3 miles (13,168') the path narrows and steepens considerably on a tightly wound, rocky path headed directly for the summit. Those with a later start will likely face a good deal of downhill traffic. Methodical climbing over variously large and loose talus crosses 14,000' (2.9 miles) and relaxes on the final steps to the summit (3.1 miles : 14,265'). Views from the summit are awesome, particularly across the upper drainage and half dozen unnamed lakes in McCullough Gulch. To the west are jagged peaks and ridges that perpendicularly meet Quandary's west ridge and define the Continental Divide, Monte Cristo and McCullough drainages. Nearby 14ers include Mt Lincoln (14,291'), Mt Bross (14,172'), and Mt Democrat (14,152'). Peer down the Cristo Couloir - defined as a steep gorge or gully on the side of a mountain - a celebrated winter route to the summit that begins from Blue Lake. The summit is large enough for weekend crowds, but with limited room to explore. Take a few steps west from the summit to find a small wind shelter along a rugged, tapering ridge.",104.933333333

It occupies a wide berth in a spectacular alpine valley in the Boulder Creek drainage.  A moderate trail follows the Rock Creek, Gore Range and Boulder Creek trails through montane and subalpine forests to the lake. A more challenging trek continues west on an unmaintained route to Upper Boulder Lake: From the parking area, follow the Rock Creek Trail to the Gore Range Trail and bear right (.4 miles : 9,638'). The Gore Range Trail moderates on a rolling climb through lodgepole stricken by pine beetle. Despite aesthetic damage to the canopy, the forest floor is healthy with grasses and flowers. Travel eases above a large meadow that attracts moose and elk (.8 miles : 9,798'). It keeps straight through a false intersection with faint spurs branching left and right (1.0 miles : 9,895'). The trail crests at 1.75 miles (10,127') and tilts sharply downhill on a winding course to the Gore Range Trail - Boulder Creek Trail junction (2.35 miles : 9,685'). Turn left (west) on the Boulder Creek Trail. The Boulder Creek Trail bypasses a blocked off split to the left (2.45 miles), and bears left at an unmarked split shortly after (2.5 miles). The first split is part of the original trail that's recently been closed and re-routed due to erosion. The second is actually the main trail, which leads over Boulder Creek to the lake's north shore and continues another 3+ miles to Upper Boulder Lake (10,984'). A No Fire sign just past the 2nd split ensures the right choice. The path you're now following climbs steeply and levels by a large meadow on the southeast shore of Boulder Lake (2.85 miles : 9,782'). A good social trail runs along Boulder Lake's marshy perimeter, but you must improvise your way over the outlet stream to re-join the main trail on the north shore. Though classified as an unmaintained route west of the lake, it can be taken up-valley for over a mile before losing clarity.",88.2

It fills a narrow bowl tightly hemmed by moraines churned from the slopes of Rain Peak (13,130') and East Thorn (13,333'). Though long at 15.3 miles roundtrip, mild trail conditions make it an achievable day hike with an early start.  Visitors will enjoy miles of deep woods travel, excellent fishing and access to nearby Willow Lakes: Follow Rock Creek Trail to the Gore Range Trail and bear left (.4 miles : 9,638'). The Gore Range Trail drops to a large meadow and crosses North Rock Creek (.6 miles : 9,505'), then rises steeply into a thick, quiet forest (1.0 miles : 9,795'). Though beetle kill is prevalent, the forest floor remains unaffected and busy with life and color. The trail bends sharply east (1.15 miles : 9,895') and laces several small ponds before resuming a due-south course. The pace quickens beyond 1.5 miles on a gradual descent to South Rock Creek (2.75 miles : 9,888'). Once over, it climbs steeply to a signpost leading left around the north edge of two large, lily covered ponds (3.0 miles : 10,074'). Travel eases to mile 4 (10,292'), where it glides downhill and narrows over a creek (4.5 miles : 10,184'). The trail steepens past the creek into a vast blow-down area (5.2 miles : 10,315'), leveling through its skeletal remains to the Salmon - Willow Trail split (5.5 miles : 10,332'). The Salmon-Willow Trail bends southwest and rises sharply on a wide, rocky path into the subalpine. It moderates past 6.5 miles to the Salmon Lake Trail split (7.15 miles : 11,061'), which climbs the lake's north moraine with a revealing look over the basin. The trail drops to the west shore of Salmon Lake (7.65 miles : 11,192'). Salmon Lake's inlet area is fairly open and level, but exploration is limited. Clusters of mature spruce offer good cover and privacy for backpackers. Grays Peak (14,270') and Torreys Peak (14,267') stand on the southeast horizon, and your eyes can trace the inlet's origin to a gulch between Rain Peak and East Thorn. Salmon Lake's east shore provides a more scenic backdrop, but you'll have to scramble across rugged moraines to reach it.",88.2

The climb moderates past 6.5 miles to the Salmon Lake Trail split (7.15 miles : 11,061'), where it flattens across a rock field (7.35 miles : 11,105') and over Salmon Lake's outlet stream (7.45 miles : 11,089'). The Willow Lakes Trail shifts frequently in a thin forest where snow, runoff and overgrowth may obscure it at various times of year. The trail crosses a wide pool along North Willow Creek (7.8 miles : 11,214') and skirts a large pond (8.0 miles : 11,237') to big views of Red Peak (13,189') and the serrated wall of Zodiac Ridge. It rolls through an expanding alpine landscape to Willow Lake #1 (8.2 miles :11,247'), the smallest of the three. It's a short scramble to its cluttered shore, something you might skip in favor of views across the entire basin from the main trail a short distance ahead. Still, those with time may opt to follow the west shore and climb the inlet to reach the outlet area of Lake #2, which has a complete view of this deceptively large lake, and one that's not possible from the main trail (Willow Lake #2 is hemmed by Red Peak, which limits exploration). The main trail continues up-valley to a faint spur for Willow Lake #2 (8.35 miles : 11,364'), a rugged but compelling excursion. The Willow Lakes Trail undulates gently above an oblong pond - often mistaken for one of the lakes - to the edge of Willow Lake #3 (8.7 miles : 11,424'). Upper Willow Lake fills a steep-walled bowl just over treeline. Unlike the first two, it's shore is free of obstacles and easily explored. Scale its south slope for panoramas across the basin, and a chance to see mountain goat that inhabit cliffs and spires above the lake.",88.2
313,Crystal Lakes (Summit County - Eagle County - Clear Creek County),summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,8.6,10390,12874,2482,3,True,"The Crystal Lakes are located just south of Breckenridge at the head of a broad glacial valley in the Ten Mile Range. Lower Crystal Lake occupies a shallow basin in a wide berth midway up the Crystal Creek drainage, and Upper Crystal Lake is located 1.9 miles and 900' up in a high-walled cirque carved from the slopes of Father Dyer Peak (13,615') and Crystal Peak (13,852').  Though Lower Crystal Lake is accessible by 4WD car, many visitors opt to walk up from the Spruce Creek Trailhead to fully experience this idyllic alpine landscape. Upper Crystal Lake is open only to foot travel, a more challenging trek into the high country with exceptional views and wildlife that includes marmot, ptarmigan, mountain goat and bighorn sheep: From Spruce Creek Trailhead, continue up the dirt road to Crystal Creek Road - #803 and bear right (.25 miles : 10,495'). Crystal Creek Road steepens considerably through mixed pine to a forest road intersection and keeps straight (1.25 miles : 11,229'). Grades moderate in a thinning forest with emerging views of Mount Helen's east ridge to the Wheeler National Recreational Trail junction (1.45 miles : 11,382'). Keep straight. The road-trail passes through treeline into an expansive alpine valley with stunning views of Mount Helen (13,164'), Father Dyer Peak and Crystal Peak (1.75 miles : 11,481'). Crystal Creek cuts through the wide valley floor, a good place to find moose and bedded down elk. Adjacent meadows support an array of flowers and thick mats of willow. The grade relaxes up-valley to Lower Crystal Lake (2.4 miles : 11,959') and remains of an old cabin. A mining road branches left up the flank of Mount Helen, a social trail leads up the lake's open south shore, and the main trail continues north over the outlet. Once over the outlet, the dirt road quickly fades into a wide, grassy track on a winding course over the Crystal Lake basin. Lingering snow may conceal the path, but patient eyes should find the way. The trail gradually bends NE and climbs steadily up the north valley wall. At 3.0 miles (12,284') it banks west, east, then west again as it narrows on a rocky path on a direct line into the tapering upper valley. The ramp-like trail rises steadily with big views down-valley, and great vantages for seeing mountain goat and bighorn sheep. Be mindful of loose rock and steep drop-offs around you. The trail passes through a slot and crests over the rocky cirque holding Upper Crystal Lake (4.2 miles : 12,927'). The main trail continues west around the cirque, while a social trail can be seen down around the lake's east shore. The latter is where you want to be, but there's no clear way to reach it; simply find a convenient place to drop through the talus - roughly 80 yards - to the north shore of Upper Crystal Lake (4.3 miles : 12,874'). Upper Crystal Lake is tightly bound by steep rock walls, but the east shore is open and easily explored. Improvise your way east through open tundra to two large ponds and commanding views down the Crystal Creek drainage.",100.533333333
314,Mayflower Lakes,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,5.2,10390,11365,975,3,True,"The Mayflower Lakes are located high above Breckenridge at 11,365' along the Spruce Creek Trail. While there is one main body of water, the name's plurality comes come various tarns - or glacial pools - and small water pockets near the lake's main outlet. The Spruce Creek Trail is open to hiking, fishing, backpacking, mountain biking and winter recreation, but no motorized vehicles are allowed.  The trail heads west over Spruce Creek (.1 miles) and climbs steadily through a mix of lodgepole, aspen and Engelmann spruce for 1.4 miles to the Wheeler Trail junction (1.5 miles : 10,974'), also known as the Wheeler National Recreation Trail. The landscape opens considerably past the split in a large, marshy meadow with impressive views of Mt Helen (13,164').  Look for deer, elk, moose and grouse in this food-rich habitat. Visitors are encouraged to admire the fragile marsh ecosystem from its edge and avoid treading on sensitive vegetation. The trail skirts the meadow, re-enters the forest and climbs .6 miles to a clearing at an intersection with Spruce Creek Road and two green utility sheds (2.1 miles : 11,151'). It runs into the dam of a small reservoir about 100 yards past the utility sheds and veers right toward signs for Mayflower and Mohawk Lakes. It resumes in a thinning forest past mining and homestead ruins (2.5 miles : 11,331') to the edge of Mayflower Lakes (2.6 miles : 11,365'). Close examination reveals a single body of water flanked by numerous outlying ponds to the east, a collection of disjointed pools rather than a second 'formal' lake. Those wanting a longer, more arduous adventure should consider hiking past Mayflower Lakes to Lower Mohawk Lake (11,861') and Upper Mohawk Lake (12,110').",100.5
315,Mohawk Lake and Lower Mohawk Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,6.7,10390,12073,1683,4,True,"Lower Mohawk Lake (11,861') and Mohawk Lake (12,110') are located 2.95 and 3.35 miles from the Spruce Creek Trailhead south of Breckenridge, CO. The lakes sit just at and above treeline along the south flank of Mt Helen in a spectacular glacial valley in the Ten Mile Range.  Those with time may divert to nearby Mayflower Lakes, or continue past Mohawk Lake through open tundra to a string of 5 alpine lakes and tarns in the upper valley: The trail heads west over Spruce Creek (.1 miles) and climbs steadily through aspen, fir and spruce for 1.4 miles to the Wheeler Trail split on the edge of a large, marshy meadow (1.5 miles : 10,965'). This is a good place to break and look for wildlife, epsecially moose and elk. The Spruce Creek Trail turns west beside the meadow up to Spruce Creek Road, (2.0 miles : 11,120'), which you'll follow to its terminus at a water utility station. Cross the dam and follow signs (right) off the road to pick up the trail (2.1 miles : 11,151'). Travel steepens to the Mayflower Lakes split (2.35 miles : 11,285') and crosses a creek, past which the trail braids in several places. These social trails typically lead to views of Continental Falls, mining remains or established campsites - and in most cases link back to the main trail artery. Look for cairns to stay on track and do your best to avoid crosscutting sensitive vegetation. The trail twists steeply by a mining cabin to a marked split for Lower Continental Falls Vista (2.55 miles : 11,385'). It follows a useful mining cable past the falls split up steep open rock to the edge of Lower Mohawk Lake (2.95 miles : 11,810'). Lower Mohawk Lake lies at treeline below Mount Helen (13,164'), a fine stopping point if limited by time or weather. Continental Falls pour from its outlet, and there's plenty of shoreline to explore. The trail continues along the shore before breaking away on a steep, twisting climb through treeline to Mohawk Lake (3.35 miles : 12,073'). The trail braids again in several places on this final push, however intuitive travel leads uphill in each instance. Mohawk Lake fills a large, steep-walled bowl with great views back down valley of Lower Mohawk Lake and Mt Helen. A tight but navigable shoreline offers anglers plenty of room to cast, though exploration is somewhat limited by pitch. Scale the lake's north wall to pick up an intuitively followed social trail into the upper valley, which opens dramatically below Pacific Peak (13,950'), Crystal Peak (13,852') and Father Dyer Peak (13,615'). The route skirts a small lake directly above Mohawk (3.55 miles : 12,219') and continues across relatively flat open tundra to three more - 3.9 miles (12,334'), 4.25 miles (12,372') and 4.55 miles (12,438'). A fifth - Pacific Tarn - requires a steep climb with no discernable route past the fourth lake.",100.5
316,James Peak,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,8.3,10428,13294,2866,4,True,"James Peak (13,294') straddles the Clear Creek Ranger District, Sulphur Ranger District and James Peak Wilderness Area boundaries. It's named after Edwin James, a physician and botanist who was among the first to catalogue plants of the Rocky Mountains. There are several ways to reach James Peak, each with unique attractions and challenges.  The following description begins at the St Mary's Glacier Trailhead and follows an unofficial but well-defined route to the Continental Divide Trail, which continues up to the summit: The trail begins on a wide, rocky forest road heading northwest. Keep left of all offshoots, and within clearly drawn property lines on each side of the road. The road-trail rises quickly through a high subalpine forest that breaks suddenly across a bridge across the outlet of St Mary's Lake (.45 miles : 10,738'). Note bristlecone pine in the area, a species adapted to high altitudes and extreme weather conditions. The trail is somewhat ill-defined but intuitively followed along the NE shore toward the snow field. It narrows on a clearer path through dense willows and emerges on the north shore just below the snowfield. A few steps off-path leads to the base of St Mary's Glacier (.75 miles : 10,848'). The trail continues up the north side of the glacier over churned rocks and soil pushed to its margins by the annual growth and recession of the snow mass. Footing can be tricky, and depending on the time of year, you may very well need to walk directly on the glacier. A well-defined path soon appears on the glacier's south side, where you'll ultimately need to be - cross the glacier at a convenient point and resume travel beside it. The snowfield tapers up a narrow gulch to its top (1.1 miles : 11,236'), where the path levels on the edge an immense tundra flat. James Peak (right) and Mount Bancroft (left) emerge on the western horizon, while Grays Peak (14,270') and Torreys Peak (14,267') stand out to the south. Travel eases considerably through the open flat on a westerly heading toward James Peak, crossing a Jeep-ATV road at 2.0 miles (11,641'). Though the trail disappears once over the road, a number of trail markers about 75 yards away - clearly visible in the open tundra - will connect you back to it. Improvise your way to the markers and continue west on a well-cut path toward James Peak. The trail moves quickly through an expanding landscape to the base of James Peak, where it bends south and steepens up its east face (2.5 miles : 11,818'). The trail soon merges at a cairn - but otherwise unmarked point - with the Continental Divide Trail (2.8 miles : 12,020'). This is an important point, as you'll need to recognize this split on the return. The trail grows intermittently rocky and steep on a winding course up the mountain's east face, but seldom too much of one or the other to slow travel. It briefly straightens on a westerly heading, edging close to the deep chasm between Mount Bancroft (13,250') and James Peak (3.0 miles : 12,195'). Views of Ice Lake emerge in a spectacular cirque between the adjacent peaks, and with a few steps off trail, down the entire Loch Lomond drainage (see photo gallery). The trail skirts a perennial snowfield (3.4 miles : 12,535') and gradually bends northwest up a broad slope with views of James Peak Lake, Little Echo Lake and the Mammoth Gulch drainage in the northern valley below (3.8 miles : 12,880'). A final push over two false summits levels on the large summit of James Peak (4.15 miles : 12,295'). The summit area is large, flat and easy to explore. Maneuver about for a revealing look down the Loch Lomond and Mammoth Gulch drainages, and over the vast tundra flat through which you traveled to reach the base of James Peak. There are several rock-wind shelters on the summit.",56.9166666667
317,St Mary's Glacier,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,1.5,10428,10848,420,2,True,"St Mary's Glacier is located 9.2 miles north of Idaho Springs in the Clear Creek Ranger District of the Arapaho National Forest. The glacier - technically a large perennial snowfield - is a popular year-round destination open to hiking, skiing, glissading, climbing and sledding.  St Mary's Lake, located just below the glacier, is ringed by bristlecone pine, thick willow and abundant wildflowers. Though easily reached, exploring the glacier can be dangerous. Caution is a must for any activity - even casual walking - on the snowfield. Important NoteThe land through which you'll pass to reach St Mary's Lake and St Mary's Glacier is private. Landowners are not obligated to allow access, though they've permitted the public to do so for many years. Visitors should respect private land, stay on designated trails and pass with minimal impact. Fishing and camping may only take place on public lands north of the lake. It's the public's responsibility to know of and adhere to private property lines. **** The trail heads northwest on a wide, rocky forest road. Keep left of all offshoots (these lead to private homes), and within clearly drawn property lines on each side of the road. The road-trail rises quickly in a high subalpine forest that breaks suddenly at a bridge over St Mary's Lake outlet (.45 miles : 10,738'). Notable in this area are bristlecone pine, which thrive in extreme alpine environments and can live thousands of years. The trail is somewhat vague but intuitively followed up the northeast shore of St Mary's Lake to the glacier. It narrows on a clearer path through dense willows and emerges on the north shore just below the snowfield where it melts into St Mary's Lake (.75 miles : 10,848'). The trail continues up the north side of the glacier over churned rocks and soil pushed to its margins by the annual growth and recession of the snow mass. Footing can be tricky, and depending on the time of year, you may very well need to walk directly on the glacier to explore its upper reaches. You'll soon see a well-defined path on the glacier's south side, arguably a more stable option that's safely reached once grades moderate. The snowfield tapers quickly up a narrow gulch that levels abruptly in vast open tundra (1.1 miles : 11,236'). Glass this expanse for elk, bighorn sheep and mountain goat. James Peak (13,294') and Mount Bancroft (13,250') frame the west; James Peak is accessible by an unofficial but well-marked route that joins the Continental Divide Trail up to the summit.",56.9166666667
318,Whitney Lake,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,5.25,9110,10956,1846,3,True,"Whitney Lake is located 2.62 miles from Homestake Road in the Holy Cross Wilderness. It lies at the base of Whitney Peak (13,271') in a thick subalpine forest. The short hike is highlighted by verdant aspen groves, flower-covered slopes and good fishing at the lake. Despite a few steep sections the trail is generally moderate and ideal for families: Trail Map | Photo Galleries The trail rises quickly from Homestake Road through the first of three aspen groves. It moderates across the base of an airy slope (.5 miles : 9,510') before turning sharply uphill with views across the Homestake Creek valley. The trail enters another stretch of aspen and steepens to a second open slope with emerging views of Savage Peak (13,139') and adjacent peaks in the heart of the Sawatch (1.2 miles : 10,050'). Note swaths of skunk cabbage, a member of the lily family with large, lettuce-like leaves. Skunk cabbage is thermogenic, meaning it can produce heat that exceeds ambient temperatures. It's this complex metabolic process that creates the unpleasant smell for which it's named. The trail reaches a third aspen grove that's abruptly succeeded by mixed conifers leading to a bridge over Whitney Creek (1.65 miles : 10,430'). If damaged, it may simply be easier/safer to get in the water and cross the creek (especially for backpackers). A short, steep push from the bridge soon levels in a tall spruce-fir forest to Whitney Lake (2.62 miles : 10,956'), which is hemmed against the south flank of the Whitney Peak massif. The lake is ringed by thick timber, but social trails thread much of the shore with good access for anglers. Note: campsites at the lake may be closed for revegetation. Contact the Holy Cross District for the latest information about camping and fires at Whitney Lake (970.827.5715).",136.3
